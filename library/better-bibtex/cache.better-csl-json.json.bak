Debt sustainability analysis based on empirical estimation of inter-temporal budget constraint and fiscal policy response function in a panel data framework, covering 20 Indian states for the period 1980–1981 to 2015–2016, indicates that the debt position at the state level is sustainable in the long run. The increase in contingent liabilities of states and take-over of large chunk of these liabilities through debt restructuring of State Power Distribution Companies, however, would adversely affect the debt position of states.\",\"accessed\":{\"date-parts\":[[\"2024\",3,24]]},\"author\":[{\"family\":\"Kaur\",\"given\":\"Balbir\"},{\"family\":\"Mukherjee\",\"given\":\"Atri\"},{\"family\":\"Ekka\",\"given\":\"Anand Prakash\"}],\"citation-key\":\"kaurDebtSustainabilityStates2018\",\"container-title\":\"Indian Economic Review\",\"container-title-short\":\"Ind.

The IMF has developed a sophisticated approach but it must be recognized that, because the future is unknown, any debt sustainability assessment is only valid within the bounds of the underlying guesses. There is no support for the view that added complexity allows for more precise assessments. As a consequence, policy conclusions drawn from debts sustainability exercises must be considered with care.
