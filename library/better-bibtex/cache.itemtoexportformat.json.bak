Debt sustainability analysis based on empirical estimation of inter-temporal budget constraint and fiscal policy response function in a panel data framework, covering 20 Indian states for the period 1980–1981 to 2015–2016, indicates that the debt position at the state level is sustainable in the long run. The increase in contingent liabilities of states and take-over of large chunk of these liabilities through debt restructuring of State Power Distribution Companies, however, would adversely affect the debt position of states.","date":"2018-12-01","language":"en","shortTitle":"Debt sustainability of states in India","libraryCatalog":"Springer Link","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s41775-018-0018-y","accessDate":"2024-03-24T01:41:55Z","volume":"53","pages":"93-129","publicationTitle":"Indian Economic Review","DOI":"10.1007/s41775-018-0018-y","issue":"1","journalAbbreviation":"Ind.

As a consequence, policy conclusions drawn from debts sustainability exercises must be considered with care. Sacrificing growth – in the short and even in the long run – to imprecisely known risks can be very costly.","date":"2007","language":"en","shortTitle":"Debt Sustainability Assessment","libraryCatalog":"ideas.repec.org","url":"https://ideas.repec.org//p/gii/giihei/heiwp03-2007.html","accessDate":"2024-04-06T18:19:12Z","extra":"Number: 03-2007\nPublisher: Economics Section, The Graduate Institute of International Studies","seriesTitle":"IHEID Working Papers","publicationTitle":"IHEID Working Papers","creators":[{"firstName":"Charles","lastName":"Wyplosz","creatorType":"author"}],"tags":[{"tag":"Exchange Rates","type":1},{"tag":"External debt","type":1},{"tag":"International Economics","type":1}],"collections":["5IUUGAVJ"],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-04-06T18:19:12Z","dateModified":"2024-04-10T02:33:35Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/U2SYyaSt/items/4ADAAWQJ","itemID":1928,"attachments":[{"key":"CKTVWTQQ","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"HEIWP03-2007.pdf","parentItem":"4ADAAWQJ","linkMode":"imported_file","contentType":"application/pdf","charset":"","filename":"HEIWP03-2007.pdf","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-04-06T18:19:52Z","dateModified":"2024-04-06T18:19:52Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/U2SYyaSt/items/CKTVWTQQ","localPath":"D:\\Santhosh PKM\\Library\\storage\\CKTVWTQQ\\HEIWP03-2007.pdf","defaultPath":"files/1930/HEIWP03-2007.pdf"},{"key":"PTJF6N94","version":0,"itemType":"attachment","title":"Snapshot","url":"https://ideas.repec.org/p/gii/giihei/heiwp03-2007.html","accessDate":"2024-04-06T18:19:27Z","parentItem":"4ADAAWQJ","linkMode":"imported_url","contentType":"text/html","charset":"utf-8","filename":"heiwp03-2007.html","tags":[],"relations":{},"dateAdded":"2024-04-06T18:19:27Z","dateModified":"2024-04-06T18:19:27Z","uri":"http://zotero.org/users/local/U2SYyaSt/items/PTJF6N94","localPath":"D:\\Santhosh PKM\\Library\\storage\\PTJF6N94\\heiwp03-2007.html","defaultPath":"files/1929/heiwp03-2007.html"}],"notes":[]},"meta":{"revision":0,"created":1722120405751,"version":0},"$loki":8}],"idIndex":null,"binaryIndices":{"itemID":{"name":"itemID","dirty":true,"values":[2,0,1]}},"constraints":null,"uniqueNames":[],"transforms":{"Better BibTeX metadata":[{"type":"Better BibTeX metadata","value":{"Zotero":"7.0.0-beta.107+2917f41cb"}}]},"objType":"itemToExportFormat","dirty":true,"cachedIndex":null,"cachedBinaryIndex":null,"cachedData":null,"adaptiveBinaryIndices":false,"transactional":false,"cloneObjects":true,"cloneMethod":"parse-stringify","asyncListeners":false,"disableMeta":false,"disableChangesApi":true,"disableDeltaChangesApi":true,"autoupdate":false,"serializableIndices":true,"disableFreeze":true,"ttl":null,"maxId":9,"DynamicViews":[],"events":{"insert":[],"update":[],"pre-insert":[],"pre-update":[],"close":[],"flushbuffer":[],"error":[],"delete":[null],"warning":[null]},"changes":[],"dirtyIds":[]}
