 <br><br>Adverse Selection&nbsp;occurs when the more desirable attributes of a market withdraw due to asymmetric information. This could be better quality products, better quality consumers or better quality sellers. The result is that consumer and producers may not make transactions that are socially beneficial, transactions that would yield positive producer and/or consumer surplus. <br>Adverse selection occurs when the uninformed side of a deal gets exactly the wrong people trading with it (i.e., it gets an adverse selection of the informed parties).<br>Adverse selection refers to the situation where asymmetric information on the part of one party in an economic transactions leads to desirable good remaining unsold, even though they would be sold in a market with full information.<br>This is the market failure associated with <a data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="\notes\asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asymmetric Information</a> the ability of the more informed agents to exploit their advantage.]]></description><link>notes\adverse-selection.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Adverse Selection.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 20:32:08 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Aranyaka]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Asymmetric information refers to a state where market players have different levels of information about each other's valuations of the market. As such, their&nbsp;information is asymmetric, or asymmetrically distributed.<br>In classical economic theory, information is assumed to be complete and evenly distributed among market players: each player knows how the other players value the items being traded in the market.&nbsp;This simplifies the analysis of the market because the players' actions will be certain and predictable.&nbsp;Market outcomes (prices and quantities) can then be easily calculated.<br>Asymmetric information can be used as a source of power in determining the outcome of the transaction. As a consequence, the market will not achieve allocative efficiency.<br>"A high degree of asymmetric information can create conditions under which voluntary or market-based transactions become infeasible" (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/EW52ATBW?page=19" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="zotero:\\open-pdf\library\items\EW52ATBW?page=19" target="_blank">Kelkar and Shah 2019:19</a>)<br><br>
<br>These differences are the underlying causes of&nbsp;<a data-href="Adverse Selection" href="\notes\adverse-selection.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Adverse Selection</a>.

<br>There must be little to no transactions costs
<br>(Following 2.) There must be few affected parties (or else the transactions costs of organizing them gets to be too great).
<br>There must be no wealth effects. 
<br>The efficient solution will be the same, regardless of who gets the initial property rights.<br>The Coase Theorem shows that the essence of the market is not price, but property rights. As long as there are property rights, people will naturally "negotiate" a reasonable price.<br>The Coase theorem implies that the market will solve externalities all by itself unless:<br>

 <br>The economist Evsey Domar in his pioneering work, “The Burden of Debt and National Income” (1944) carried out while he was a member of the Board of Governors of the US Federal Reserve System, offers answers to these questions. The paper centered on the discussion of the dynamics of public debt and economic growth, and it assessed the risks of public debt and emphasized the need to push economic growth rather than being skeptical about increase in public debt. The Domar condition states that for the public debt of a country to be sustainable, the nominal rate of growth of the economy should be greater than the growth rate of nominal public debt. As long as this condition is met, according to the Domar model, any level of public debt is sustainable, and the country remains solvent.<br>Domar (1944) argued that the ratio of public debt to GDP would be stable in the long run provided that the growth rate of GDP exceeds the effective interest rate on public debt.]]></description><link>notes\domar-debt-sustainability.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Domar Debt Sustainability.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:33:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ethos (Rhetoric)]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Fallacies of ethos&nbsp;relate to credibility. These fallacies may unfairly build up the credibility of the author (or his allies) or unfairly attack the credibility of the author’s opponent (or her allies).<br><br>Ad hominem: attacking the person making an argument rather than the argument itself.<br>Example: “Of course that doctor advocates vaccination—he probably owns stock in a pharmaceutical company.”<br>False authority: relying on claims of expertise when the claimed expert (a) lacks adequate background/credentials in the relevant field, (b) departs in major ways from the consensus in the field, or (c) is biased, e.g., has a financial stake in the outcome.<br>Example: “Dr. X is an engineer, and&nbsp;he&nbsp;doesn’t believe in global warming.”<br>Guilt by association: linking the person making an argument to an unpopular person or group.<br>Example: “My opponent is a card-carrying member of the ACLU.”<br>Poisoning the well: undermining an opponent’s credibility before he or she gets a chance to speak.<br>Example: “The prosecution is going to bring up a series or so-called experts who are getting a lot of money to testify here today.”<br>Transfer fallacy: associating the argument with someone or something popular or respected; hoping that the positive associations will “rub off” onto the argument.<br>Examples: In politics, decorating a stage with red, white, and blue flags and bunting; in advertising, using pleasant or wholesome settings as the backdrop for print or video ads.<br>Name-calling: labeling an opponent with words that have negative connotations in an effort to undermine the opponent’s credibility.<br>Example: “These rabble-rousers are nothing but feminazis.”<br>Plain folk: presenting yourself as (or associating your position with) ordinary people with whom you hope your audience will identify; arguers imply that they or their supporters are trustworthy because they are ‘common people’ rather than members of the elite.<br>Example: “Who would you vote for—someone raised in a working-class neighborhood who has the support of Joe the Plumber or some elitist whose daddy sent him to a fancy school?”<br>Testimonial fallacy: inserting an endorsement of the argument by someone who is popular or respected but who lacks expertise or authority in the area under discussion.<br>Example: “I’m not a doctor, but I play one on TV”—a famous example of a celebrity endorsement for a cough syrup (Deis, 2011, n.p.).]]></description><link>notes\fallacies-of-ethos.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Fallacies of Ethos.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:33:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fallacies of Logos]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Is the speaker or author attempting to divert your attention from the real issues? These are some of the elements you might consider while evaluating an argument for the use of logos.<br>Pay particular attention to numbers, statistics, findings, and quotes used to support an argument. Be critical of the source and do your own investigation of the “facts.”<br><br>Hasty generalization: jumping to conclusions based upon an unrepresentative sample or insufficient evidence.<br>Example: “10 of the last 14 National Spelling Bee Champions have been Indian American. Indian Americans must all be great spellers!”<br>Appeal to ignorance—true believer’s form: arguing along the lines that if an opponent can’t prove something&nbsp;isn’t&nbsp;the case, then it is reasonable to believe that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;the case; transfers the burden of proof away from the person making the claim (the proponent).<br>Example: “You can’t prove that extraterrestrials&nbsp;haven’t&nbsp;visited earth, so it is reasonable to believe that they&nbsp;have&nbsp;visited earth.”<br>Appeal to ignorance—skeptic’s form: confusing absence of evidence with evidence of absence; assumes that if you cannot now&nbsp;prove something exists, then it is shown that it doesn’t exist.<br>Example: “There’s no proof that starting classes later in the day will improve the performance of our high school students; therefore, this change in schedule will not work.”<br>Begging the question: circular argument because the premise is the same as the claim that you are trying to prove.<br>Example: “This legislation is sinful because it is the wrong thing to do.”<br>False dilemma: misuse of the either/or argument; presenting only two options when other choices exist<br>Example: “Either we pass this ordinance or there will be rioting in the streets.”<br>Post hoc ergo propter hoc: Latin phrase meaning “after this, therefore because of this”; confuses correlation with causation by concluding that an event preceding a second event must be the cause of that second event.<br>Example: “My child was diagnosed with autism after receiving vaccinations. That is proof that vaccines are to blame.”<br>Non-sequitur: Latin for “does not follow”; the conclusion cannot be inferred from the premises because there is a break in the logical connection between a claim and the premises that are meant to support it, either because a premise is untrue (or missing) or because the relationship between premises does not support the deduction stated in the claim.<br>Example (untrue premise):“If she is a Radford student, she is a member of a sorority. She is a Radford student. Therefore she is a member of a sorority.”<br>Smoke screen: avoiding the real issue or a tough question by introducing an unrelated topic as a distraction; sometimes called a red herring.<br>Example: “My opponent says I am weak on crime, but I have been one of the most reliable participants in city council meetings.”<br>Straw man: pretending to criticize an opponent’s position but actually misrepresenting his or her view as simpler and/or more extreme than it is and therefore easier to refute than the original or actual position; unfairly undermines credibility of&nbsp;claim&nbsp;if not source&nbsp;of claim.<br>Example: “Senator Smith says we should cut back the Defense budget. His position is that we should let down our defenses and just trust our enemies not to attack us!”]]></description><link>notes\fallacies-of-logos.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Fallacies of Logos.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:33:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fallacies of Pathos]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>An appropriate appeal to&nbsp;<a data-href="Pathos" href="\notes\pathos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Pathos</a>&nbsp;is different than trying to unfairly play upon the audience’s feelings and emotions through fallacious, misleading, or excessively emotional appeals. Such a&nbsp;manipulative&nbsp;use of pathos may alienate the audience or cause them to “tune out”.<br>Even if an appeal to pathos is not manipulative, such an appeal should complement rather than replace reason and evidence-based argument. In addition to making use of pathos, the author must establish her credibility (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Ethos (Rhetoric)" data-href="Ethos (Rhetoric)" href="\notes\ethos-(rhetoric).html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Ethos</a>) and must supply reasons and evidence (<a data-href="Logos" href="\notes\logos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Logos</a>) in support of her position. An author who essentially replaces logos and ethos with pathos alone should be given low marks.<br><br>Appeal to fear: using scare tactics; emphasizing threats or exaggerating possible dangers.<br>Example: “Without this additional insurance, you could find yourself broke and homeless.”<br>Appeal to guilt and appeal to pity: trying to evoke an emotional reaction that will cause the audience to behave sympathetically even if it means disregarding the issue at hand.<br>Example: “I know I missed assignments, but if you fail me, I will lose my financial aid and have to drop out.”<br>Appeal to popularity (bandwagon): urging audience to follow a course of action because “everyone does it.”<br>Example: “Nine out of ten shoppers have switched to Blindingly-Bright-Smile Toothpaste.”<br>Slippery Slope: making an unsupported or inadequately supported claim that “One thing inevitably leads to another.” This may be considered a fallacy of logos as well as pathos but is placed in this section because it often is used to evoke the emotion of fear.<br>Example: “We can’t legalize marijuana; if we do, then the next thing you know people will be strung out on heroin.”<br>Appeal to the people: also called&nbsp;stirring symbols fallacy; the communicator distracts the readers or listeners with symbols that are very meaningful to them, with strong associations or connotations.<br>Example: This fallacy is referred to in the sentence “That politician always wraps himself in the flag.”<br>Appeal to tradition: people have been done it a certain way for a long time; assumes that what has been customary in past is correct and proper.<br>Example: “A boy always serves as student-body president; a girl always serves as secretary.”<br>Loaded-Language and other emotionally charged uses of language: using slanted or biased language, including God terms, devil terms, euphemisms, and dysphemisms.<br>Example: In the sentence “Cutting access to food stamps would encourage personal responsibility,” the god term is “personal responsibility.” It might seem as if it would be hard to argue against “personal responsibility” or related god terms such as “independence” and “self-reliance.” However, it would require a definition of “personal responsibility,” combined with evidence from studies of people’s behavior in the face of food stamp or other benefit reductions, to argue that cutting access to food stamps would lead to the intended results.]]></description><link>notes\fallacies-of-pathos.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Fallacies of Pathos.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:33:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fallacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>This theory states that there is no possible way for an election to happen that meets the specific criteria of rationality and reasonable democratic values at the same time. Some of the democratic values, which are the dimensions evaluating the electoral process, expected to be met include the following:<br>
<br>Absence of dictatorship
<br>Pareto efficiency
<br>Universality of alternatives
<br>Independence from irrelevant alternatives
<br>Impossibility to express false preferences
<br>It is worth noting that this theory assumes that the individual economic agents who are involved are rational.<br>The theory of social choice leads to the fundamental question: "Under what conditions do the aggregate preferences of a group of individuals become rational while satisfying certain axiological conditions?" This question attempts to find out whether it is possible to develop a social choice function that sums up all individual preferences to come up with a social order that is rational and democratic. In summary, Arrow's theorem concludes that there exists no rule of aggregation or preference that possesses normative properties which are desirable unless a dictator forces these preferences.<br><a data-href="Kenneth Arrow" href="\people\kenneth-arrow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Kenneth Arrow</a>]]></description><link>notes\impossibility-theorem-kenneth-arrow.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Impossibility Theorem - Kenneth Arrow.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:33:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Informal Fallacy]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Logos, or the appeal to logic, means to appeal to the audiences’ sense of reason or logic. Logos can also be thought of as the text of the argument. <br>To use logos, the author makes clear, logical connections between ideas, and includes the use of facts and statistics. Using historical and literal analogies to make a logical argument is another strategy. There are also more traditional forms of logical reasoning such as <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism" rel="noopener" class="external-link" title="Syllogism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllogism" target="_blank">syllogisms</a> and <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthymeme" rel="noopener" class="external-link" title="Enthymeme" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthymeme" target="_blank">enthymemes</a> <br>There should be no holes in the argument, also known as logical fallacies, which are unclear or wrong assumptions or connections between ideas.<br>Aristotle had a tip here: He found that the most effective use of logos is to encourage your audience to reach the conclusion to your argument on their own, just moments before your big reveal. <br>See also: <a data-href="Fallacies of Logos" href="\notes\fallacies-of-logos.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fallacies of Logos</a>]]></description><link>notes\logos.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Notes/Logos.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:33:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Market Failure]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Market power: One party in the negotiation has little power and experiences a loss of choice.
<br>Asymmetric Information: The process of negotiation works poorly as there is a lack of information.
<br>Externalities: There are channels of influence between two parties that are not negotiated.
<br>Public goods: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.

 <br>It is a classical economic theory that says that the income generated by past production and sale of goods is the source of spending that creates demand to purchase current production.<br>Briefly stated, this law means that ‘supply always creates its own demand.’ In other words, according to J.B. Say, there cannot be general over­production or general unemployment on account of the excess of supply over demand because whatever is supplied or produced is automatically exchanged for money<br>Whenever additional production takes place in the economy, necessary purchasing power is also generated at the same time to absorb the additional supply; hence, there is no scope of supply exceeding demand and causing unemployment. This law was the basis of their assumption of full employment in the economy which rested on the plea that income is spent automatically at a rate which will always keep the resources fully employed.<br>Savings, according to classical are just another form of spending; all income, they believed, is partly spent on consumption and partly on investment. There is no ground to fear a break in the flow of income stream in the economy. Hence there cannot be any general over-production or unemployment.<br>The classical economists always assumed a state of employment in the economy. The normal situation in an economy, according to them was full employment equilibrium. Less than full employment, they believed, was an abnormal situation. Classical always held that there are no lapses from full employment equilibrium and even if there are any, there is always a tendency to return to full employment. This belief of the classical economists was based on the views of a French economist, J.B. Say (1767-1832).<a data-footref="1" href="\#fn-1-583657e487316db2" class="footnote-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">[1]</a><br><br>

This comprehensive anthology represents the key issues and problems in the ﬁeld of medical ethics through the most up-to-date readings and case studies available. Each of the book’s six parts is prefaced with helpful introductions that raise important questions and skillfully contextualize the positions and main points of the articles that follow.

People often have strong feelings about some of these issues (for example, abortion and euthanasia). On some issues, many of us do not know what to think (for example, IVF for older women, or using children born without a higher brain as sources of transplantable organs). The assumption in philo- sophical bioethics is that careful analysis can help us at least make progress on some of these issues, if not resolve all of them. However, some are skeptical about this assumption. They believe, for a variety of reasons, that ethical disputes are, in principle, unre- solvable by rational means.<br>Princeton philosopher Gilbert Harman defines "moral nihilism" as "the doctrine that there are no moral facts, no moral truths, and no moral knowl- edge." Extreme nihilists think that nothing is right or wrong; that morality, like religion, is an illusion that should be abandoned. This implies that tortur- ing, raping, and killing a young child is not wrong something few people could accept. More moderate nihilists do not recommend abandoning morality, but, rather, offer a theory about the mean- ing of moral terms that explains why there are no moral facts, truths, or knowledge.<br>The theory of moral language that is offered by moderate moral nihilists is known as "emotivism." Emotivists believe that moral utterances do not ex- press facts, or tell us anything about how the world is. Rather, they express our feelings. Therefore, such statements are not-indeed, cannot be true or false, any more than "Go, Yankees!" is true or false. The statement "Abortion is wrong" does not say anything about abortion, but rather expresses some- one's negative feelings about abortion.<br>Another form of moderate moral nihilism denies the possibility of moral truth independent of a partic- ular culture. This view, known as "ethical rela- tivism," says that morality is relative to the society one lives in and the way one was brought up. The rightness or wrongness of an action or practice can- not be determined apart from the cultural or social context in which it occurs.&nbsp;<br>Support for ethical relativism comes from three sources. <br>
<br>
First, it stems from an observation that dif- ferent cultures have different moral beliefs and prac- tices. However, simply noting moral differences in various cultures does not establish ethical rela- tivism. Ethical relativism goes beyond noting that cultures differ in their moral beliefs and practices;

<br>
There are plenty of heated disagreements among scientists. How- ever, scientists agree (in principle) about what kinds of evidence would settle a dispute. There is no such agreement in ethics. In other words, we do not have a decision procedure for resolving ethical disputes. This is the second source of support for ethical relativism.

<br>
The third reason for relativism is quite different. It offers a moral reason for adopting relativism: namely, that relativism promotes tolerance toward people who hold moral beliefs different from one's own. This apparently was the motivation of nineteenth-century anthropologists who wished to prevent Western imperialists from imposing their culture on indigenous peoples.

<br>Negative<br>
These terms also have considerable factual content, so that it is not "just a matter of opinion whether a practice is cruel, exploitative, or unjust.<br>According to relativism, right and wrong are always relative to culture. What a culture (or the majority of a culture) thinks is right is right- for them. However, a moral reformer challenges the conventional beliefs of his or her own culture.<br>Relativism simply cannot make sense of the claims of moral reformers. Since we do understand the claims of moral reformers, and at least sometimes are influenced by them, it seems that relativism cannot be true.<br>At the same time, relativism has two things to recommend it, which we believe can be incorpo- rated into a nonrelativist approach. First, the rela- tivist is right to point out that morality occurs in a cultural context. Before presuming to judge another culture's practices and beliefs, we would do well to try to understand them "from the inside." We may still decide ultimately that a practice is wrong, but we are not entitled to make this judgment without understanding the practice in context. Second, rela- tivism encourages multiple perspectives on and so- lutions to moral problems. Both of these insights are present in "multiculturalism."<br>&nbsp;Multicultural- ism requires an open mind toward the customs and beliefs of other cultures, but such open-mindedness need not, and should not, be uncritical. It is entirely consistent with a conception of morality as amenable to rational considerations, and the con- viction that there can be better or worse moral justi- fications.<br>How are we to assess moral reasons and argu- ments? Intuitively, most of us can probably recog- nize good-or especially bad-moral reasoning, but in complicated situations we are often left wondering whether a consideration is pertinent. Is assisted suicide wrong because it helps someone to kill himself or herself, and killing is wrong? Or is it right because it helps someone do what he or she reasonably wants to do, and thus promotes auto- nomy? To answer questions of this sort, we need "a framework within which agents can reflect on the acceptability of actions and can evaluate moral judgments and moral character." Such a frame- work is known as an "ethical theory."<br>Traditionally, ethical theories tend to be reduc tionist; that is, they offer one idea as the key to morality, and attempt to reduce everything to that one idea. For example, classical utilitarians main- tain that right actions are those that promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number, while Kantians tell us that right actions are those that can be consistently willed universally. Each theory claims to have discovered the single, overarching standard of morality or right action.<br>In recent years, a number of philosophers have come to doubt that any normative theory can plau- sibly claim to be the correct theory. It may be that moral reality is sufficiently complex that any one theory gives only partial insight.<br>We conclude that it is a mis- take to view the various theoretical alternatives as mutually exclusive claims to moral truth. Instead, we should view them as important but partial con- tributions to a comprehensive, although necessarily fragmented, moral vision.<br>Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) are generally credited with developing the first detailed and systematic formulation of the ethical theory known as "utilitarianism." The heart of utilitarianism is "the greatest happiness princi- ple," which, as Mill puts it, "holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happi- ness; wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness." The greatest happiness principle is also known as the principle of utility. The utility of an action is determined by its tendency to produce<br>The first thing to note about utilitarianism is that it is a "consequentialist" theory. That is, it judges the rightness and wrongness of an action by its conse- quences, or what will happen if the action is or is not performed. Second, utilitarianism's theory of value says that good consequences are those that produce or promote happiness or pleasure, bad consequences those that produce or promote the reverse. As we will see, both consequentialism and utilitarianism's theory of value have lately come under attack.<br>utilitarianism is a form of consequentialism, and thus it holds that the results of actions are the only relevant feature in assessing actions. Consider- ations of an agent's intentions, feelings, or convic- tions are seen as irrelevant to the question,<br>Another important feature of utilitarianism is its impartiality. The utilitarian does not say, "The goodness of an action is determined by the amount**of happiness it produces for me." Rather, the good is determined by the overall net happiness achieved. The utilitarian considers his or her own happiness, but no more and no less than the happiness of oth- ers.**&nbsp;In weighing the effects of an action, utilitarian- ism maintains that we must take into consideration all of the parties concerned and that all parties shall be given equal consideration. Thus, utilitarianism is committed to the value of equality.<br>**<br>To summarize the advantages of utilitarianism, first, it reduces vagueness by providing a single criterion of right action: namely, the promotion of human happiness. Moreover, happiness, whether understood as pleasure or as preference satisfaction, is something that can be empirically measured. Utilitarianism thus provides an objective standard&nbsp;<br>for judging whether an action is right or wrong, and a method for resolving moral disputes. Finally, and more importantly, the principle of utility is derived from the very point of morality, which is to improve the lot of human beings living together. Morality does not relate to the satisfaction of some abstract or arbitrary code; rather, it relates to the improvement of the human condition, which means alleviating suffering and increasing happiness**<br>In addition, the focus on human happiness seemed to conflict with Christian teachings; for example, those teachings espousing the value of suffering.<br>One objection is to utilitarianism's theory of value: namely, the claim that happiness is the greatest good, the ultimate end. Critics have maintained that this theory leaves out many other "goods," such as health, friendship, creativity, intellectual attainment, and so forth. Mill agreed that these things are all valu- able, but argued that they are valuable because they contribute to a happy life, one as rich as pos- sible in enjoyment and as free as possible from pain. However, it remains questionable whether all values are commensurable; that is, whether all values can be reduced to happiness, however hap- piness is interpreted. And even if it were possible to reduce the plurality of values to a single value, happiness, is it possible to compare and weigh the happiness of one person against that of another?<br>What if an action will make one person intensely happy but leave several people somewhat de- pressed? Exactly how are we to arrive at the right utilitarian solution? Moreover, some people feel things more intensely than others. Should we pay attention to the strength of desires? On the one hand, it seems that we should, since the intensity of an individual's happiness or unhappiness af- fects the total amount, and utilitarianism tells us to maximize happiness. On the other hand, this gives an advantage to the passionate over the phlegmatic that seems to violate Bentham's dic- tum that everyone counts for one, nobody for more than one.<br>A second objection to utilitarianism is that it requires us to calculate the probable consequences of every action, and this task is impossible. The sheer calculations alone would prevent anyone from doing anything. In response, it should be noted that both Bentham and Mill thought of util- itarianism primarily as a guide to legislative pol- icy, rather than as a guide to individual behavior.<br>**<br>Being utilitarians in our private lives does not mean that we must calculate all the consequences of every act, which would be impossible. Instead, we can rely on what Mill calls secondary principles, like "Don't lie," and "Don't harm others." We know from centuries of experience that adherence to these secondary principles promotes the greatest happi- ness for all, while departure from them causes inse- curity and misery.&nbsp;<br>A more recent criticism of utilitarianism (or consequentialism generally) concerns the**<br>
**theory of responsibility it implies. For nonconsequentialists, it can be very significant whether an outcome occurs because of something I did, whereas for consequentialists all that matters ultimately is what happens. This has led some consequentialists to reject a time-honored distinction in medicine, the distinction between killing and "letting die." Many doctors believe that it is permissible for them to stop treatment when death is desirable; for exam- ple, in the case of a terminally ill patient in a great deal of pain who wants to die. However, they think&nbsp;<br>it would be wrong (as well as illegal) actively to kill a patient in that same situation. Utilitarians, by contrast, are likely to regard killing and letting die as morally equivalent, since the outcome-a desir- able death is achieved in both cases (see Part 3, Section 6).&nbsp;<br>A final major criticism of utilitarianism is that it is inadequate as a moral theory because it conflicts with some of our most basic moral intuitions.**<br>Suppose we could greatly increase human happiness and diminish misery by occasionally, and perhaps secretly, abducting derelicts from city streets for use in fatal but urgent medical experiments. If utilitarian con- siderations were decisive, this practice might well be justifiable, even desirable. Yet it is surely wrong. Such a case suggests that we cannot always explain good and bad simply in terms of increasing or decreasing overall happiness.*<br>However, they maintain that the fact that this practice would con flict with many people's deeply held moral convic- tions is not a worthwhile criticism of utilitarianism. Many utilitarians are quite skeptical of "deeply held moral convictions," which they regard as often no more than irrational superstitions.<br>Rule-Utilitarianism versus Act-Utilitarianism<br>**<br>Mill left unresolved the question whether the great- est happiness principle is to be applied to specific acts or to general kinds of acts. It has been suggested that if we apply the principle to kinds of acts, we can avoid some of the criticisms of utilitarianism. The version of utilitarianism that is primarily concerned with the consequences of specific acts has become known as "act-utilitarianism," while the version pri- marily concerned with the consequences of general policies is called "rule-utilitarianism."&nbsp;<br>Act-utilitarianism tells us to apply the principle of utility directly to the particular act in question.**<br>An act-utilitarian would seek to determine which alternative in this particular case would maximize happiness and/or minimize suffering<br>**<br>By contrast, rule-utilitarianism uses the princi- ple of utility not to decide which acts to perform or avoid, but rather to formulate and justify moral rules. The correct moral rules are those that&nbsp;<br>pro- mote the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Faced with a decision about how to act, rule- utilitarianism tells us that we are not to appeal. directly to the principle of utility. Rather, we are to consider whether this action falls under a rule that is justified by the principle of utility.**<br>Rules are regarded differently by rule-utilitarians. Rules are not just devices to help us figure out what will maximize happiness in a particular case. The rules themselves are justified on the grounds that having these particular rules maximizes happiness. But once we decide what the best rules are (that is, which ones are most likely to maximize happiness over the long run), then those are the rules we should follow, even if following them in a particular situa- tion doesn't maximize happiness.<br>**<br>Rules are regarded differently by rule-utilitarians.

But once we decide what the best rules are (that is, which ones are most likely to maximize happiness over the long run), then those are the rules we should follow, even if following them in a particular situa- tion doesn't maximize happiness.&nbsp;<br>Thus, the rule-utilitarian can apparently avoid the sorts of situations that make act-utilitarianism unsat- isfactory to many. In brief, the rule-utilitarian agrees with the act-utilitarian that the value of just practices resides in their tendency to promote happiness; but he will not agree that it is permissible to perform an unjust act in order to maximize happiness.**<br>Is Rule-Utilitarianism an Improvement over Act- Utilitarianism? Act-utilitarians make this criticism of rule-utilitarianism: It makes no sense for a utili- tarian to insist that a rule that will have less than optimal consequences should be followed simply. because the rule maximizes happiness in general.<br>&nbsp;It would not be rational from the standpoint of utility to refuse to break a moral rule when by doing so you could maximize welfare. For this reason, Smart calls rule-utilitarianism "superstitious rule worship."9<br>But now it seems that whatever would lead the act-utilitarian to break the rule would lead the rule-utilitarian to modify the rule. Thus, the two versions give exactly the same advice; they are "extensionally equivalent," so rule-utilitari- anism cannot be an improvement over act-utilitari- anism.<br>A related objection to rule-utilitarianism is that it collapses into act-utilitarianism. For whenever an act-utilitarian would say it was right to break a moral rule, it seems that the rule-utilitarian would gener- ally agree, but instead say that the rule should be modified.]]></description><link>sources\books\steinbockmoralreasoningmedical2013.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">sources/Books/steinbockMoralReasoningMedical2013.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:34:33 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRkpAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;source=gbs_api" length="0" type="false"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PRkpAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;source=gbs_api&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Be a Stoic]]></title><description><![CDATA[

In the tradition of How to Live and How Proust Can Change Your Life, a philosopher asks how ancient Stoicism can help us flourish today Whenever we worry about what to eat, how to love, or simply how to be happy, we are worrying about how to lead a good life. No goal is more elusive. In How to Be a Stoic, philosopher Massimo Pigliucci offers Stoicism, the ancient philosophy that inspired the great emperor Marcus Aurelius, as the best way to attain it. Stoicism is a pragmatic philosophy that focuses our attention on what is possible and gives us perspective on what is unimportant. By understanding Stoicism, we can learn to answer crucial questions: Should we get married or divorced? How should we handle our money in a world nearly destroyed by a financial crisis? How can we survive great personal tragedy? Whoever we are, Stoicism has something for us--and How to Be a Stoic is the essential guide.Extracted Annotations (11/19/2022, 4:40:40 AM)

<br><br>Abstract
As a $3-trillion economy, India is on her way to becoming an economic superpower. Between 1991 and 2011, the period of our best growth, there was also a substantial decline in the number of people below the poverty line. Since 2011, however, there has been a marked retreat in the high growth performance of the previous two decades. What happened to the promise? Where have we faltered? How do we change course? How do we overcome the ever-present dangers of the middle-income trap, and get rich before we grow old? And one question above all else: What do we need to do to make our tryst with destiny? As professional economists as well as former civil servants, Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah have spent most of their lives thinking about and working on these questions. The result: In Service of the Republic, a meticulously researched work that stands at the intersection of economics, political philosophy and public administration. This highly readable book lays out the art and the science of the policymaking that we need, from the high ideas to the gritty practicalities that go into building the Republic.

The interventions by the state should be primarily located around these four problems.”<br>When market failure is not present, we should be sceptical about state intervention<br>All activities of the state are grounded in coercion: either<br>
<br>directly (The state can demand certain behaviour, and threaten violence against private persons who refuse to comply.) or 
<br>indirectly (The state can demand tax payments from the populace, backed by threats of violence against people who do not comply).”
<br>Private persons overproduce things that impose negative <a data-href="Externalities" href="\notes\externalities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Externalities</a> as pollution and underproduce things that impose positive externalities;<br>
modifications to tax rates can help improve the outcome. <br>The state can choose to spend tax revenues in two ways. <br>
<br>It can run state organizations such as the police, which produce certain public goods. 
<br>Or, it can transfer money to private persons All states do some amount of redistribution
<br>For example, relief work done by the government after a natural disaster is a case of transferring the money obtained in coercive ways (through taxation) from the populace to the affected people.” Subsidies can be unconnected to externalities; they can be pure redistribution.”<br>These transfers can be linked to market failure (e.g., using education vouchers to address the externalities in education) or they can be pure redistribution<br>
“The world of public policy is about these three levers: rules about behaviour, taxation, and spending money.”
<br>The state is supposed to be a machine that converts coercive power into human welfare. A coercive agent is poorly placed at solving failures of negotiation.<br>The essence of market failure is the channels of influence between two persons which are not governed by negotiations and choice: <br>
<br>Market power: One party in the negotiation has little power and experiences a loss of choice.
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Asymmetric Information" data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="\notes\asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asymmetric information</a>: The process of negotiation works poorly as there is a lack of information.
<br>Externalities: There are channels of influence between two parties that are not negotiated.
<br>Public goods: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.”
<br>The state is a coercive agent. At the heart of market failure is a failure of coordination, of a lack of negotiation. There is a tension at the core, where problems of coordination are not easily solved through the tool of coercion. <br>Some people might like to have a paternalistic government. Coercive power gives the state the ability to take from one and give to another, and this will make some people happy at the expense of others.  State paternalism can then only be in favour of some and not all.<br><br><br>“First, there is the political economy problem, and governments are hijacked by special interest groups to aim for the wrong objectives. And then, there is the state capacity problem, where government fails to achieve the objective that it seeks to solve.”<br><br>
<br>Situations where freedom works well:<br>
where the right thing for the government is to do nothing but the government is doing something
<br>There is a market failure, but the politics goes wrong:
<br>There is a market failure, and the objectives of policymakers were sound, but the design of the intervention was wrong:
<br>There is a market failure, the correct intervention was attempted, but the implementation failed:
<br>This four-part thinking is more useful than the more conventional classification scheme of ‘political economy problems’ versus ‘state capacity problems<br><br>The three key steps in policy thinking are:<br>
<br>Are we facing a market failure? If not, there is no role for the state.
<br>Does the proposed intervention address this market failure? Sometimes, we see proposed solutions which do not address the claimed problem.
<br>Do we have the ability to effectively implement the proposed intervention? Many times, an idea might be sound but, under present capacity constraints, the implementation of the proposed intervention may be infeasible
<br><br>In an ideal world, the state is a benevolent actor, which establishes the right priorities, and is able to marshal the resources to achieve good outcomes. This is not the world that we live in. Public policy in India is characterized by a great deal of failure. We tend to establish the wrong objectives, and then we tend to fail on achieving these objectives. What are the sources of state failure in India?<br>
<br>The information constraint<br>
What you measure is what you can manage.<br>
Policymakers mostly lack high-quality data about the society in which they seek to operate.  
<br>The knowledge constraint<br>
Public policy is a research process, and we in India lack the foundations of knowledge for operating this research process.
<br>The resource constraint<br>
As a thumb rule, it is useful to reckon that the cost to society for every rupee of public spending is around Rs 3.<br>
In the best advanced economies, the numerical value for the <a data-href="Marginal Cost of Public Funds" href="\Marginal Cost of Public Funds" class="internal-link is-unresolved" target="_self" rel="noopener">Marginal Cost of Public Funds</a> is from 1.5 to 2.”
<br>The administrative constraint

<br>Principal–agent problems<br>
Government organizations contain the hardest management problem. How do we obtain good behaviour from employees that wield coercive power, while lacking good measures of performance, and having no threat of organizational extinction?
<br>Three cross-cutting problems that are found in all organizations are human resource management, the financial process and the procurement process.<br>
In Indian system these are not established
<br>In every organization, there are front-line producers and then there is an enormous overhead of monitoring, measurement, management and strategy.”<br>
A low teeth-to-tail ratio is required for the organization to work well. Too often, in India, we have organizations which are all teeth and no tail.
<br>Politics without romance<br>
we used to think of the state as a pristine, benevolent actor who would work for the best interests of the people. Now we think about the incentives of politicians and officials, who pursue their own personal objectives.<br>
This intuition was formalized in the field of ‘Public Choice Theory’ which used economic analysis to think about the objectives of politicians and officials
<br>The yearning for heroes<br>
The objective of reform is not to hire saints, but to achieve a state which yields good outcomes when each actor is self-interested.<br>
Example: The fruit of the poisonous tree - The lack of this doctrine in India—the implicit belief that policemen are benign persons who mean well—is a major source of arbitrary power and thus the abuse of power by enforcement agencies in India.
<br>Who will mind the minder<br>
Public choice theory encourages us to think that all officials and all politicians are cut from the same cloth. We have to construct systems of checks and balances, that will work through rational incentives of all parties, and without assumptions that any one person is a saint.”


<br>The voter rationality constraint

<br>Incentives of voters: the average person does not have the incentive to invest in learning about policy problems. 
<br>The limits of voting systems<br>
The great economist <a data-href="Kenneth Arrow" href="\people\kenneth-arrow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Kenneth Arrow</a> proved an ‘<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Impossibility Theorem - Kenneth Arrow" data-href="Impossibility Theorem - Kenneth Arrow" href="\notes\impossibility-theorem-kenneth-arrow.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Impossibility Theorem</a>’, which shows that voting systems are not able to consistently aggregate the preferences of voters. 5 Specifically, Arrow defined three sensible criteria that a reasonable voting system ought to simultaneously satisfy, and proved that no voting system could achieve all the three at the same time. This emphasizes how voting and elections are less useful than meets the eye, in finding the right pathways for policy
<br>Populism<br>
the collection of popular policy ideas. judging a policy initiative by its popularity among the masses is unwise.
<br>Representative democracy - An alternative that works
<br>Incentives, not technology<br>
Technologies to allow every person to vote on policy questions are designed - but they are not incentive compatible. 


<br><br><br>People respond to incentives. Human behaviour is not fixed; it changes when the incentives change. When policy changes, human behaviour changes.<br>Politicians and officials also respond to incentives<br>A government organization that is riven with corruption is not one which was unlucky to get a lot of corrupt people. It is one where the rules of the game facilitate corruption.”<br>The task of public policy research is to identify the formal rules which have incentive implications for the behaviour of officials and politicians. When the rules change, the culture will change. Politicians and officials respond to incentives. This has a big and optimistic implication. Changes in the rules of the game will generate behavioural changes on politicians and officials also. The behaviour of politicians and officials is also malleable. The puzzle of policy design is that of finding the checks and balances, and the rules of the game, through which politicians and officials will generate good outcomes for society when they pursue their own self interest.<br><br>When 'high-powered incentives’ are set up, the agent single mindedly focuses on achieving that measure, and sacrifices everything else.<br>This proves to be particularly important when transplanting ideas from advanced economies into India<br><br>
When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Goodhart’s law, 1975
<br><a href=".?query=tag:CharlesGoodhart" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#CharlesGoodhart</a><br><br>“Liberalism—the respect for the values, beliefs and decisions of others—is integral to economics as it is to no other branch of human knowledge.”<br>While human beings mostly do well in understanding incentives and doing the best for themselves, the new field of ‘behavioural economics’ has documented many kinds of mistakes that human beings make in understanding information, risk and time.<br><br>In practice, obtaining and processing information is costly. Humans are rational in choosing where to expend such effort<br><br>The field of behavioural economics has emphasized that humans seem to exhibit a very low regard for events deep in the future. There is a certain kind of short-termism that is wired into us; we tend to make decisions based on outcomes nearby in time.<br>These concerns have gone from novel criticism of the mainstream, with the ‘bounded rationality’ of Herbert Simon of the 1950s, to becoming the mainstream, with the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. <br>The optimal stance of policy is not obtained if we think of human beings as perfectly effective at understanding information and making sound decisions.”<br><br><br>Rules of Public Policy<br>
<br>Supply and demand make the price,
<br>Demand curves slope downward and supply curves slope upward,
<br>There is a law of one price,
<br>The policymaker should have no opinion on the price, and no tools to directly control it.”
<br>A gap between supply and demand is a problem. Prices move in order to remove imbalances between supply and demand. The movement in price solves this problem by inducing changes in both supply and demand. Every time a government interferes in the movement of a price, it hampers this adjustment process.<br>When the price goes up, less is demanded (‘demand curves slope downward’). When the price goes up, more is supplied (‘supply curves slope upward’). People are rational and change their behaviour. At a higher price, there is more supply and less demand.<br>Policymakers of a socialist vintage are hostile to the word arbitrage. However, arbitrage is the basic human instinct of removing the difference between two different prices for the same thing, and earning a profit while doing this.<br>The correct price is the one made by supply and demand, untrammelled with political influences. <br>
The market is not an invention of capitalism. It has existed for centuries. It is an invention of civilization. - <a href=".?query=tag:MikhailGorbachev" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#MikhailGorbachev</a>
<br>Controls on prices are illegitimate and do not work.<br>“How do we break out of the cobweb model (decisions made based on past data)? <br>Storage (also called ‘hoarding’) is the technique through which goods are transported from a time point where they are cheap to a time point where they are expensive. Futures trading looks into the future, and produces a forecasted price at the harvest date which can be used for sowing decisions or storage decisions. Free trade (within India and across the border) generates arbitrage, where cheap goods are taken away and additional supply brought in when prices are high.”<br><br>

<br>domestic trade and
<br>international trade
<br>The best functioning economy is one in which changes in supply and demand rapidly result in a change in the price<br>Supply and demand make the price. When prices go up, demand goes down. When prices go up, supply goes up. Free men and women will buy things where they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive, and thus arbitrage away pricing discrepancies. When there are large changes in a price in a short time, this can be disconcerting and impose problems upon some people. But if the government forces the price to change slowly, this makes things worse.<br>Prices are the mechanism through which the market economy adjusts to shocks; by hindering price movement we postpone adjustment. In India, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary have all repeatedly undertaken actions which go against the grain of the price system. These actions are doomed to failure. When the policymaker tries to control the price, this is harmful, and the greatest harm is done when the policymaker tries to control both the price and the quantity. The policymaker should have no opinion on prices and not try to control prices. Policymakers must strengthen their intuition into the working of the price system, and go with the grain. The field of public policy is about identifying and addressing market failure, not controlling prices.<br><br><br>Competition pushes firms to cut costs, to innovate, and to deliver the best bargains for customers.<br>All across the economy, we require a progressive outlook supporting entry and competition. Policymakers must constantly use the power of the state to prise open closed systems, to create conditions of extreme competition, and to see the bright side of firm failure. <br><br>The prolonged survival of a weak firm, based on artificial life support, induces negative externalities upon healthy firms. The exit of these ‘zombie firms’ is a positive for the economy. <br>For this to work properly, we require a well-functioning bankruptcy process. In this, the key distinction is between firms with valuable organizational capital and those without.<br>The lingering presence of these firms increases the cost of Inputs for healthy firms, and reduces the profitability of healthy firms. When a policy framework encourages the lingering survival of failed firms, this harms healthy firms in that sector.<br>This is one reason why public sector companies are a problem for the economy: there is a greater risk of them becoming zombie firms backed by the exchequer. This is bad for public finance and bad for the economy.<br>Economic dynamism requires closure. When business failure turns into investigations, there is no closure.<br>A society that pillories entrepreneurs, and turns business failure into protracted disputes or entanglement in agencies, is one which will have less entrepreneurship.<br><br> Consider a future date when the bankruptcy process works well. Under such conditions, when a business cycle downturn commences, weak firms will go into the bankruptcy process and get rapidly processed, their swift exit will improve profit margins of the survivors, and the resource reallocation will generate GDP growth. Faster that this process can play out, the shorter the downturn will be. A sound bankruptcy process gives less severe business cycle downturns”<br>The Indian economy features the coexistence of high-productivity firms that abide by laws with low-productivity firms that violate laws. When law enforcement improves, and weak firms exit, GDP growth will be obtained through reallocation of labour and capital. <br><br>Market power results in bad outcomes, regardless of whether the actor in question is public or private. We should be as zealous about dismantling state-induced barriers to competition as we are when attacking market power created by private persons.<br>Creative destruction is not alien to India: for small firms, it is the everyday reality. It is only with the large firms, and the areas connected with government, where competitive dynamics is poor.”<br><br>The effects of a given policy change may not show up in a concentrated fashion. But if small changes are spread over a large number of economic agents all over the economy, they may add up to a substantial impact (whether benign or malign) even if they are not sharply visible at any one place<br>By default, we are wired to look more narrowly. For reasons of functional specialization, the lines of turf, and the limitations of our minds, it is easier to look at one firm or one sector at a time. This is ‘partial equilibrium’ thinking. But every policy thinker must maintain a general equilibrium perspective in the back of her head.<br>There is a relationship between the short run vs the long run, and partial equilibrium vs general equilibrium. In the short run, we see the first effects of a policy change, which are smaller in their scope. But with the passage of time, all parts of the system adjust, and we achieve the full general equilibrium effects. Conversely, to think about the long run requires general equilibrium thinking.<br>We normally see a few firms or an industry at a time. But actually, all parts of the economy are connected together in ‘general equilibrium’. Every change in one firm or one market induces ripples in every other market. The full general equilibrium effects play out slowly. In areas like tax policy, globalization, agriculture, or universal basic income, general equilibrium thinking has a lot to offer in understanding the policy issues.<br><br>When two alternative tools yield the same outcome, we should prefer the one which uses the least coercion.<br>“The two objectives—reduced use of coercive power and solving a problem at the root—are related.”<br>Criminal penalties in economic law should be viewed with great suspicion<br>We should solve the disease and not the symptoms. This calls for an analysis of the root cause of market failure.”<br><br><br>There is an ever-present danger of paternalism, of policy thinkers who feel they know how poor people should lead their lives. Poor people have their own tastes and their own budget constraints. We should respect what they are doing. Poor people have minds and preferences and pursue their own objectives<br>It is hard for the state to be paternalistic as it does not know enough about individuals. Each person is different, and only the individual can choose what is best for herself. When the government tries to be paternalistic, value judgements are made by policymakers which are not amenable to rational discourse.<br>In addition, public choice theory encourages us to be sceptical when a politician or an official engages in paternalism. In addition to the lack of empathy (i.e., the policymaker is unable to step into the shoes of a poor person, and see the world from her eyes), there may also be self-interest at work.<br><br> No country solved poverty through redistribution. The first priority of policymakers should be to establish a vibrant market economy, through which the size of the pie grows strongly. After this, taxation can be used to obtain budgetary resources which are then redistributed. <br>Prioritization of growth oriented policies.<br>Growth is the most powerful, and only effective, anti-poverty weapon.<br>Poverty is not a market failure.<br>Govt has a role for one lean redistribution and disaster relief. <br>Distortions of the market economy, induced in the pursuit of redistribution, hinder GDP growth. That is tantamount to killing the golden goose.<br>Subsidies distort behaviour of recipients. The marginal cost of public funds in India is high. The cost imposed upon the economy for Re 1 of public expenditure is about Rs 3. This implies that subsidy programmes induce a large adverse impact upon the GDP. It is easy to build state capacity for paying out subsidies such as the NREGS; it is hard to build state capacity for public goods such as the police. Competing political parties tend to enlarge subsidy expenditures as a way to win elections. The establishment of large subsidy programmes and the sense of entitlement that tends to arise around them create fiscal risk. <br>The cleanest way to do redistribution is to pay out cash. We should let the price system do its job of effectively allocating resources, so as to obtain high GDP growth. The market economy would grow the pie, the government would tax a slice of the pie, and use this money for redistribution.<br><br>The assignment principle teaches us that one tool of policy should be devoted to one objective. <br>Fighting poverty should be the clear objective of one or two anti-poverty programmes. The objective of the remainder of government should be to address market failure, without bringing distributional considerations into the picture.<br>
Policy thinkers were attracted by three key features of workfare programmes. They are self-targeting:<br>
Only the poorest would utilize them.<br>
They are self-adjusting: When there are remunerative activities, e.g., associated with an agricultural cycle, there would be an automatic reduction in workfare.<br>
Finally, they are self-liquidating: Once incomes in a certain region go up, through economic growth, nobody would want to do manual labour at Rs 100/day. Over the years, these programmes would tend to fade away on their own.”
<br>the best-thought-out redistributive programmes often go wrong. Successful redistribution makes great demands upon the capabilities of the policy process. <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:RonaldCoase" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#RonaldCoase</a> brought fresh insight into this field, with what is called the ‘transaction costs perspective' <a data-href="Coase Theorem" href="\notes\coase-theorem.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Coase Theorem</a><br>

Cost–benefit analysis is thus about creating an institutionalized application of mind. It is a way of ensuring that the right questions are asked, and alternatives evaluated, before a decision is made. This helps avoid impressionistic and casual approaches to policy formulation, and reduces the extent to which sectarian considerations dominate.<br>Going beyond the qualitative recognition of a market failure, it is important to quantify the benefit that would be obtained for society by addressing the market failure.

We always see things more clearly in hindsight. The idea of ex post review is not to pillory the people who looked at the information at a certain point in time, e.g., in a moment of crisis, and made a decision.<br>It is to establish feedback loops through which a process of iterative refinement sets in. Cost–benefit analysis is required for government intervention into society. It is not essential when doing internal reorganization of government organizations.

Through this, it induces an institutionalized application of mind, and improves the quality of work.”<br><br>The first stumbling block in the policy process is posing the right question.

Public choice theory predicts that public organizations will favour multiple objectives as this gives reduced accountability. Clarity of purpose is efficient for the principal and not the agent.

This requires drafting modern laws that clearly articulate objectives and establish commensurate accountability mechanisms.<br><br>Formal documentation is required, before every move in public policy, which conducts such analysis.

The pain comes early and the gains come with a lag. The political puzzle of reforms lies in managing these two tensions. The art of politics lies in understanding the map of interests and pulling off such reforms. This involves understanding who will lose in the short run, negotiating with them and influencing their view of the world, modifying the reform in non-fundamental ways so as to reduce the pain upon these persons, and sometimes compensating them through other instruments. It involves harnessing the support of the gainers from the reform. <br>When a policy reform takes place, the full gains are obtained through the reallocation of resources in the economy. Policy reform requires private persons to fully internalize the new environment, and re-optimize for it. <br>Many policy reforms require the construction of institutional capacity within government and in the economy. These adjustments take time. <br>For this reason, the pain is front-loaded and the gains come with a lag. Policymakers need to understand who will lose in the short run, negotiate with them, and find compromises with them.<br><br>“The clock that counts the years to the next elections weighs heavily upon this thinking. The art of politics lies in thinking through these time horizons,<br>
<br>launching a portfolio of reforms in year 1 and year 2, 
<br>which induce pain (attenuated by specific transfers to affected parties) in year 2 and year 3, and
<br>yield overall gains by year 4 and year 5. 
<br>This requires extreme capability in the team that wins power. The incoming team cannot just land up in power, take control of the levers of power, and wield power in random ways based on political compulsions and ideology. They need to have a portfolio of policy proposals, backed by teams of experts, with fully articulated planning of actions, anticipated impacts, design of the measurement system to monitor the process on an ongoing basis, identification of the persons negatively impacted, and possibly the design of compensatory transfers to defuse the unhappiness. There is a crucial role for the communication strategy that is put into play from the date the cabinet is formed. In this age of Twitter, ‘communication strategy’ consists of catchy slogans and choice abuse. The true role of communication, however, lies in improving coordination on an economy scale. <br>The political and technocratic leadership must have a shared strategy and shared messaging, through which the full picture is consistently and strongly communicated. This would help align expectations and ensure that private persons change their strategies in ways that are coherent with the strategy of reforms. If there is no strategy in reforms, or if it is not properly communicated to the private sector, businesses and financial investors will make mistakes in the formulation of their strategies, which will result in reduced economic performance. This will increase the time lag between the policy change and its full beneficial impact. <br>Running an election campaign is analogous to the sales and advertising problem. To win power, this is essential. But if this is all that is done, sustained voter satisfaction will be elusive. Political parties need to prepare to govern, alongside campaigning to get elected. Once the election results are in, every day lost in establishing the team and kicking off a portfolio of reforms is a costly delay. We are doing too little transition planning in Indian politics.<br>When out of power, political parties should have a shadow cabinet. There should be a sustained process of engagement with think tanks, academic institutions, data sets and intellectuals, in order to cogitate about what is going wrong. The emphasis in an opposition party should be not just on criticizing what the ruling party has done, but on developing a set of plans for what would be done when in power. The incumbent ruling party equally faces this problem. At year 5, a successful ruling team is jaded, and an unsuccessful ruling team is demoralized. Yet, it needs to think through the possibility of re-election, and find the energy for transition planning. This preparatory work would be particularly valuable when it is fed into the manifesto of the political party and, when coalition governments are formed, the negotiation for a common minimum programme. The paragraphs in such documents matter disproportionately, but receive inadequate attention ahead of time. Long-range thinking and capacity building are required in each political party to develop the capability to succeed in the event of winning elections. When such developmental work is not done, ahead of time, we translate remarkable election outcomes into failures on policy.<br><br>A cult of jald baazi is taking root in India. This is the notion that a problem can be understood in a few days, and solved in a few weeks. Powerful policymakers tend to whip up a frenzy of getting things done quickly. Every expert in India has gone through the surreal experience of being ignored for years, and then asked to deliver a reform document overnight.<br>

<br>In some rare situations, a team is available in India, which is fully imbued with a problem, has the right understanding, has the right human networks in the country, has learned how to work with each other, and can move at high speed in executing a reform.<br>Even under these conditions, drafting laws and building state capacity takes a long time. In most situations, there is a starvation of intellectual capacity in the country. We lack data, knowledge, experts and teams that know how to work with each other. <br>There is thus a slow process of understanding problems, designing solutions, going up from individuals to teams with esprit de corps, and implementing reforms. The cult of speed yields failure in both cases. Even when the best teams are assembled, if the work which requires two years is compressed into a few months, this will be done badly. With weak teams, the pressure of solving a problem in a few months surely yields failure. <br>There is a pipeline in the policy reform process: data to research to policy proposals to consensus to government decisions to policy implementation. It is not possible to short-circuit this process. Some fields are at a weaker stage, where the basics of data and research are not in place. In these fields, the only horizons over which meaningful policy reform can be achieved are a long time horizon. The cult of speed is ultimately derived from management failure in government. We are faring poorly on establishing institutions which contain harmonious teams that impound information and expertise; we are unable to make long-term plans and stay focused on them. We suffer from a strong pace of personnel changes, which prevent the development of knowledge and rapport within policy teams. We suffer from three-page notes of individual reform measures, typically written by interested parties, which lack strategic thinking. We fluctuate from one topic to another, based on the crises that engulf us each day. When a government flits from one issue to the next based on the news cycle, there is no strategy. It would behove the policy process to be sceptical about the solutions that are hawked in three-page notes, to be slow and cautious. <br>We should set a high bar on the minimum level of knowledge and evidence required before embarking upon even a modest intervention into the lives of private people.<br>Policymakers in India now understand how to build a bridge. They know that building a bridge is expensive, that it requires professionals to build, that there will be a project plan, that many steps have to be undertaken, and these take time, and only then can a bridge be inaugurated. <br>The same approach is required with state capacity! When a new government organization is required: (a) It will be expensive; (b) It requires professionals to build it; (c) There must be a formal project plan in order to build the organization and its capabilities; and (d) Implementing this project plan will take time. Only when the project is completed, can a new organization be declared open for business. <br>We have repeatedly seen new organizations being launched in the Indian state in a casual and informal way. The present ways—of hiring a few people and declaring a government agency open for business within a very short time horizon—are downright harmful. Right at the outset, the organization is crushed with demands that it is ill-prepared for. The fledgling organization is underfunded and under-resourced in every possible way. It gets into a firefighting mindset, makes mistakes, and generally never recovers from the early failures. <br>We in India have learned how infrastructure projects require time and money. We need to carry this professional approach into building state capacity in government organizations. <br>the importance of building stable teams which are able to engage with the reforms process over long time horizons. - Institutional Memory <br>Each area of work is a complex problem with many moving parts.

We should not look for the newspaper headlines, the quick wins, the buzz on social media. We should instead dig into the long and slow process of genuinely building the republic. <br><br>When we think of a given government intervention, we need to judge how hard it would be for successful implementation. When we face a problem in public policy, it is important to assess how difficult it will be, to build the requisite state capacity.<br>
What are the general principles through which we can engage in such reasoning? <br><br><a href=".?query=tag:LantPritchett" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#LantPritchett</a> and <a href=".?query=tag:MichaelWoolcock" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#MichaelWoolcock</a> first posed this question and offered elements of the answer.<br>
<br>They predict that implementation is hard when there is more discretion and<br>
Discretion: If something involves more discretion in the hands of the civil servant, it is harder.
<br>when there are a larger number of transactions.<br>
Transaction intensity: If something involves a large number of transactions, by a large number of front-line civil servants, it is harder.
<br>implementation is harder when there is more at stake for private persons, and<br>
Stakes: If there are high stakes, it is harder.
<br>when there is more secrecy.<br>
Secrecy: When there is greater secrecy, it is harder.

Once capabilities are fully established, there can be a mature debate about whether the right policy pathways involve higher stakes (e.g., higher tax rates, higher punishments). ”<br>If a government organization is asked to suddenly achieve capability on a difficult problem, it will collapse in an organizational rout.<br>A natural way to sequence the construction of state capacity is to first start with an easier problem, to achieve success, and then escalate the complexity. <br>At an early stage in the republic, it will help to reduce discretion, reduce secrecy and most importantly, reduce the stakes. <br><br>There is a long tradition of secrecy in public policy in India. As the complexity of the economy has grown, and as Indian democracy has matured, it is increasingly unwise to maintain this level of secrecy.<br>
Secrecy harms planning and execution<br>
Exposing early drafts to the persons who have a lot at stake may often yield improvements in the work.<br>
Particularly when we have low state capacity, the most well-meaning reform is often marred by technical mistakes in the execution.<br>
A more open policy process catches more errors and it improves the resulting work.<br>The policy process is one of negotiation There is a valuable political economy perspective upon this question, where we see all reforms as a process of negotiation. Healthy democracies are those where various interest groups are able to sit together, engage in discourse in good faith, and emerge with reasonable compromises. The essential foundation for the democratic process of negotiation is trust—a certain presumption of good faith. We as a society need to experience decades upon decades of decent behaviour with each other, in order to learn how to trust each other to”<br>“Every reform hurts certain firms and certain persons. With more advance warning, they can plan their life better. This would reduce the costs for the economy as a whole”<br>“Give people time to change behaviour”<br>The participatory policy process, grounded in intellectual debate, generates a better reforms process. It helps avoid a policy process that is pure power play. The work is better rooted in the landscape of people and institutions. The mistakes are more likely to be taken out. The negotiations and compromises create support and legitimacy. Policy implementation works out better. <br>The best policy teams in India are well connected into intellectual capabilities, are comfortable with criticism, and are able to debate with their critics as part of the public discourse. <br>Good debate to good debate, knowledge grows.<br>
In a liberal democracy, the relationship between the policymaker and the individual is not the relationship between a ruler and a subject. The policy process is a process of negotiation. The losers from a reform require fair warning.<br>When there is ample warning, the adaptations of the private sector kick in early, and the gains for the economy are obtained in a shorter time. Confident policymakers work in the open. Working in the open signals capability. The most harmful events are those where a policy announcement shows up on a website in the evening, without any prior warning, and is effective next morning. The best episodes are those with an open consultative process, where the legal instrument showing up on the website is a non-event, and there is ample lead time between the date of announcement and the date effective.<br>Criticism and conflict have great value<br>
This policy process is a world of ideas and rational thinking, and not merely an exercise in power play. The continuous debate in an environment of dispersed power is the reason why democracies work well. The continuous process of criticism and debate finds and solves mistakes. <br>Criticism of the stated position of an agency generally strengthens the hand of the reformers within the agency. An environment where all criticism is attacked or proscribed is a recipe for policy paralysis. <br>The really important initiatives will never achieve traction without an extensive reshaping of the larger discourse, in which criticism of the status quo is of central”<br>The protagonists of a conflict criticize each other. The media creates rancour by playing up conflict. We should disagree in polite language, maintain good personal relationships, and work through formal procedures for resolving conflicts. But we should be comfortable with conflict as the normal state. In fact, it is only in an authoritarian regime that conflict is squelched, as persons are too fearful to speak up. <br><br>We must recognize that in every society, there is a market failure in the form of an under-supply of criticism. Criticizing the government imposes costs upon the critic. The gains from criticism are diffused; the entire society benefits from the criticism. The self-interest of the critic leads her to ignore the gains for society at large, and thus to under-supply criticism.<br>Formal voting systems, backed by transparency, provide a powerful mechanism for aggregating knowledge and resolving political conflicts. Particularly in an early-stage liberal democracy, where the art of give and take in political negotiation is only weakly understood, formal voting systems can often mark a big step forward from the autocratic ways.<br>We should recognize the scarcity and value of criticism, and create an environment where we disagree without being disagreeable. Every critic is engaged in altruism, and harming her own self-interest, by speaking truth to power. There is a market failure, in the form of an under-supply of criticism owing to positive externalities. It is in the self-interest of the policymaker to engage with critics, so as to improve by discovering areas of weakness in the policy work. When the policymaker is short of time, meeting the critic is more useful than meeting a supporter. Conflict and negotiation is the healthy normal state of a liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is the endless search for a middle road.”<br>To solve public policy problems, and build the republic, requires taking actions that involve risk. Real-world policymaking is extremely complicated. If we are very risk averse, and move only when we are absolutely sure, this will generate excessive conservatism. What is normal in the field of public policy is ‘complex systems failure’—where there are many moving parts and they came together in an unexpected way. Failure will happen, and when failure occurs, there is no simple concept of identifying the decisive mistake and the key person who made that mistake.<br>This requires creating an environment that is more supportive of failure. The best management culture is one in which we get credit for not taking credit. This helps create a healthy environment of trying things, accepting that some did not work, and abandoning or fixing the troubled ones.<br>need to recognize the trial and error that is required of any successful policy process. We start on a journey, and improve things based on criticism and empirical evidence. Bona fide errors are an integral part of any sound policy process. A policymaker who is not making mistakes is not trying hard enough. <br>It is better for the policymaker to honestly depict the lack of knowledge, to speak openly about all policymaking as a research process, and to embrace the process of crossing the river by feeling the stones.  <br>When we insist that no mistakes were made, the process of learning stops.<br>Wherever humanly possible, new policy initiatives should first be rolled out on a small experimental basis. This will create experience based on which we can make more rational moves in the future.And, if something does not work too well, we can back away from it without having suffered too high a cost. This is connected to an open and participatory process.<br>If the policymaker claims to know how to cross the river, there is the danger of mistakes or inaction. If, on the other hand, the policymaker only claims to know how to feel the stones, and approaches the larger community with a sense of humility, this gives an environment that is more conducive to taking risks, learning from mistakes, and refining policy strategies based on evidence. The capability of the policy community is a resource, that needs to be nurtured. An approach of acknowledging the uncertainties, and discussing and drawing lessons from failure is the key to obtaining improvements in the capability of the policy community over time. <br>Most public policy work is characterized by failure, and we would all be better off by discussing this in a comfortable and realistic way. When a policymaker lays claim to omniscience, it is difficult to admit that a mistake was made. It is better to honestly speak about the uncertainties that are being faced, and embark on policymaking as a process of discovery.”<br>The skill and rhythm that is required in the public policy landscape is different from what works in for-profit firms. Government lacks feedback loops There is thus no information system that generates feedback loops for government, in the way that accounting data and stock market data generates feedback loops in private firms.<br>
Government agencies are monopolies The customers of private firms generally have choices about whom they buy from. State agencies are generally monopolies. The only place that you can get a driver’s licence is a government office; the customer has no choice. This diminishes organizational performance.<br>
The leadership of a private firm fears financial non-performance, which will ultimately lead to the loss of jobs and empire. Persistent weak performance can induce a sale of the firm to a new shareholder, who can impose painful changes upon the firm. Private firms face the threat of a bankruptcy process where the firm can be shut down or fundamentally reorganized. None of these possibilities influence employees in the government. <br>There are rare events where a government agency is closed down. Politicians fear losing elections. Officials have no fear. <br>In government, in contrast, the oldest agencies are likely to have the most outdated internal arrangements. Government’s coercive power is qualitatively different In a private firm, the levers controlled by the management cover products, production processes and the internal organization of the firm. In government, there is similar decision-making power about the internal organization of government. But the surpassing feature of government is the monopolistic power to coerce. The state has a monopoly on violence. It is able to coerce private persons, either to pay taxes or to change behaviour. This yields a fundamental arrogance about state organizations, that private organizations do not suffer from. <br>The puzzle of public policy lies in reining in employees who have the power to coerce, to prohibit, to raid and to imprison. Government has greater complexity <br>“The state has a monopoly on violence. It is able to coerce private persons, either to pay taxes or to change behaviour. This yields a fundamental arrogance about state organizations, that private organizations do not suffer from. The puzzle of public policy lies in reining in employees who have the power to coerce, to prohibit, to raid and to imprison.<br>The public policy process plays out not just through employees but through everyone, as coercive steps by the state induce changed behaviour by the people, which feeds back into the working of the state, and so on. This further increases the complexity of decision making. Policy decisions have to take into account the internal behaviour of large complex government organizations, and then the responses of the general public which in India’s case is above a billion people. <br>Government has to prize rules over deals. In government, this evolution towards rules is carried forward to an extreme extent. Given the unique features of government, it is pragmatic to work through policy frameworks and not tactical actions. <br>We establish sound general frameworks, and work within them for a long time. We avoid transaction-specific decisions, even when we see a particular situation where the general policy is yielding the wrong answer.”<br>“Government has to prize rules over deals”<br>“Governments must disperse power Public policy requires dispersion of power. The job description for a role in public policy is a package of policy knowledge, team building and nuanced negotiating ability.  Successful governments feature a long and slow process of debate, negotiation and compromise. The leadership in the world of public policy requires the traits of listening, respecting and negotiating middle roads.<br>
Governments operate on longer horizons<br>Big sudden phenomena in the world of policy are generally harmful and/or failures.”<br><br>When a government gets involved in the working of society at the level of detail, this tends to go wrong.<br>Social engineering works badly as the real world is too complex, intervention is ridden with unanticipated effects and state capacity is limited. The most advanced economies do the least industrial policy. The government should restrict itself to addressing market failure, while being mindful to only pick a few battles given its low capabilities. <br>The economy and society should evolve as a self-organizing system, driven by the innovations of free men and women. Solving coordination problems There are, however, some situations in which there is a cautious case for ‘system thinking’ in public policy.<br>System thinking addresses traditional market failures, in the form of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Asymmetric Information" data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="\notes\asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">asymmetric information</a>, externalities and market power. In fields such as healthcare and pensions, where consumer behaviour may suffer from limited rationality, there is a greater case for system thinking. But it involves a new and daunting level of intrusive intervention, which goes well beyond the main work of public policy.”<br>In general, the coercive power of the state should not be used to hamper firms that exploit economies of scope. In some situations, however, bundling and tying raises concerns about a market failure in the form of market power. As an example, consider the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which has a dominant position in the brand awareness and distribution of insurance products. Suppose a new firm is born, with high skills in the production side of insurance products. This firm would not be able to reach consumers, as LIC has a lock on distribution and sales. LIC can get away with very poor manufacturing, as it owns the distribution. Using state power to force an unbundling, between manufacturing and distribution, can solve this problem. <br>When state capacity is low, simple and transparent interventions are favoured. A simple unbundling rule is easier to articulate and enforce, when compared with the complexity of fighting with an integrated utility that is trying to hamper access to a new entrant. <br>“When state capacity is low, simple and transparent interventions are favoured”<br>thinking is very attractive to engineers. Every engineer feels she can redesign society in certain ways that are good for everyone. But system thinking is fraught with danger. It is important to underline the use of state power, of the monopoly of violence that the state possesses, when policymakers do system thinking.<br>when system design is done in public policy, the citizenry has no choice, the solution is forced upon them backed by threats of violence, and there is a limited chance of discovering that the design was a mistake.”<br>“system thinking is fraught with danger.”<br>It is very difficult to think about design questions on the scale of society. Human systems reflect the interactions of a large number of sentient persons, and attempts at intervention are plagued by the law of unintended consequences. We may emphasize that social systems involve the interactions of many people, and envisioning these complexities requires knowledge of the social sciences and humanities, and not just engineering. Hence, the policymaker can easily be wrong.<br>
In addition, public choice theory reminds us that policymakers are just people, and are likely to pursue their own personal objectives, which may or may not align with welfare of the public.<br>
For these reasons, it is useful to approach system thinking with high scepticism, and use the coercive power of the state in reshaping society only rarely. <br>For most situations, the self-organizing system that is the market economy works better. When state capacity is low, there is a greater chance that state power will be used to impose the wrong designs upon society. There is a greater chance of this power being hijacked to serve an agenda other than public welfare. Hence, while mature market economies avoid system thinking, we in India should avoid it even more. How to do system thinking”<br>If system thinking must be done in the public policy process, how should it be organized?<br>
The first threat is that of the designers within government having the wrong design. To avoid this problem, a strong policy pipeline is required, with evidence, debate and the development of consensus in the expert community.<br>Each policy thinker should permit herself a budget constraint of supporting no more than one policy proposal, that involves system thinking, in her life. <br><br>When contract enforcement is weak, firms would specialize less, there would be greater internal production and reduced use of contracting. This would adversely impact upon transactions and thus productivity. These effects are present, but they are not particularly large. In this first cut of the analysis, the adverse impact of poor contract enforcement is relatively limited. <br>Economists have emphasized the role of the judiciary in contract enforcement, which enables the market economy. While contract enforcement is important, the more important role for judicial capacity lies in private solutions to market failure. Negative externalities can be solved through the law of torts, as long as litigation is efficacious. Many classic problems of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Asymmetric Information" data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="\notes\asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">asymmetric information</a>, where we do consumer protection, can be addressed through torts. When many people are adversely affected in a problem like pollution from a factory, the collective action problem can be solved through class action suits. When private people are able to sue, and state agencies do not have a monopoly on enforcing laws, this reduces the reliance on state agencies for enforcing laws. The agenda of economic freedom in India is ultimately about scaling back the administrative state. This journey runs through great improvements in the courts.”<br>In this book, we have emphasized the power of private negotiation, as envisioned by Ronald Coase, for arriving at private solutions to many externality problems. These private solutions can flourish when, and only when, the courts are swift and competent. <br>A great deal of market failure can be addressed through contracts, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement. <br><br>The agenda of liberalization and economic freedom requires going back to the foundations of common law: to a world of contracts, torts, private enforcement and class action lawsuits. <br>We need to push back on the new central planning system, this administrative state, and graduate to a world of much greater reliance on the judiciary, a world of contracts, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement. <br>The ‘administrative state’ is the rule of bureaucrats. This is a state where the officials manning the executive creep into controlling legislative and judicial functions. In the administrative state, politics—the process of negotiation between interest groups—has a limited role. The Indian approach to central planning of the economy, where officials have considerable control over the life of private persons, is uncomfortably close to the administrative state.”<br>“When the courts fail, we get the rule of officials.”<br><br>The public policy process requires a siege-style assault.<br><br>Stage 1 of the policy pipeline is the establishment of the statistical system. Facts need to be systematically captured. Without facts, the entire downstream process breaks down. Our only hope for truth to matter is for truth to be recorded and widely disseminated. In the modern world, few actors in the economy have an incentive to do a good job of measurement. As an example, academic economists are quite comfortable doing research with faulty data, because the academic”<br>Stage 2 of the policy pipeline is descriptive and causal research. This requires a research community which will study the data, establish broad facts and regularities, and explore causal connections. This work should be primarily grounded in the Indian locale. <br>Stage 3 of the policy pipeline is the creative phase of inventing and proposing new policy solutions. A large menu of choices needs to be at hand, for possible policy pathways. The republic is always short-changed when ‘there is no alternative’ (TINA) to one mainstream idea. At present in India, there is no community which systematically looks for fully articulated solutions. <br>Stage 4 of the policy pipeline is the public debate where rival solutions compete with each other. This requires a vigorous process of debate and discussion, in writing and in seminars. A broad consensus needs to come about on what will work, within the analytical community. In the Indian context, this is often assisted by the expert committee process. The purpose of the expert committee process is to sift through an array of possible policy pathways that are in the fray at the end of stage 3, and filter down to a few which make sense. The best expert committee reports help mainstream novel ideas in policy reform, and pull together the state of the art into a report. As Isher Ahluwalia says, nothing gets done by writing it in a government committee report, but nothing ever got done without it being repeatedly written into multiple government committee reports. <br>Stage 5 of the policy pipeline is the internal government process of decision making. This is where ministers and senior bureaucrats take stock. This is the zone of political economy, and the creative trade-offs that make progress possible. <br>Stage 6 of the policy pipeline is the translation of the decisions into legal instruments.<br>
Most policy decisions must be implemented through law that is enacted by the legislature, or subordinate legislation in the form of rules or regulations. High technical quality, and subtle detail, of this drafting process is of great importance. In India, all too often, the drafting of law is done by persons who have a superficial understanding of the prior stages of the policy pipeline, which leads to poor drafting of law.<br>Finally, stage 7 of the policy pipeline is the construction of state capacity, in the form of administrative structures that enforce the law.<br>The economist <a href=".?query=tag:SatyaPoddar" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#SatyaPoddar</a> thinks in terms of a four-part story:<br>
1. Defining the future state, or the preferred policy outcome,<br>
2. Preparing a blueprint for the design and specification of the future state,<br>
3. Defining the transition path from the current to the future state, and<br>
4. Building political consensus or garnering public support for the change.”<br>The US politician, <a href=".?query=tag:RahmEmanuel" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#RahmEmanuel</a>, famously commented that ‘a crisis is a terrible thing to waste’. Crises are important events where the ‘Overton window’ is enlarged, and there is a larger zone of possibility in stage 5 of the policy pipeline. Policymakers should be alert to these opportunities. <br>“weak institutions in India, we should dread a crisis.”<br>If we use the key ‘|’ to denote a pipe then the policy pipeline is data | research | proposals | debate | decisions | legal instruments | implementation. This is a slow, siege-style assault. There is a widespread beliefs that crises are an ideal opportunity for reforms. However, crises are difficult times. If the pipeline is not mature, ahead of time, in the heat of the crisis it is not possible to overcome the gaps in knowledge and human capacity. When crises enlarge the range of possibilities, this includes some harmful ideas. Checks and balances are less effective in a crisis. Things can more easily go wrong. Institutions that are weak in normal time<br><br>States are generally able to intervene in society in three ways.<br>
<br>Coercive power can be used to modify the behaviour of private persons, which constitutes regulation.
<br>States can produce certain services. Finally, 
<br>states can finance the purchase of certain services by private persons from private producers.
<br>The policymaker has to do many things. In what order should they be done? Too often, in India, policymakers pick one of two easy things, ‘the low hanging fruit’, and after that the reform peters out.<br>Sequencing discussions in India often degenerate into choosing low hanging fruit to begin the work, and proclaiming that an important reform has begun. <br>Sophisticated thinking on sequencing involves five elements: <br>
<br>Capacity building in the policy process: We have shown seven elements of the policy pipeline. There is a natural sequencing, going from left to right, of the order in which actions should be undertaken.
<br>Prerequisites: When x is a prerequisite for y, we have to get x in place before y.
<br>Learning by doing: Start with simple problems, learn public management, and gradually escalate complexity.
<br>Political economy considerations: Weigh the gains and the costs imposed by various alternative components, and take the ones with high economic gain but low political cost first. Early moves should create a constituency for the late moves. Early moves should not walk into a political economy trap.
<br>Stinginess: Start on a low scale on coercive power and spending, escalate only when capabilities are proven.
<br>Simple problems are those that involve a fewer number of transactions, less discretion, low stakes and less secrecy.<br> In India, we are often seeing a negative spiral. An agency has excessive coercive power, and so it fails in its work, but the political response to failure generates greater coercive power for the agency, which further reduces capability. The right response to failure by an agency should be a reduction in its coercive power.<br>The deeper question lies in how to increase state capacity. How can a country put itself on the journey to increasing state capacity, so that over time, the cost of undertaking a certain activity goes down, and the aggregate resources available to the state go up?”<br>We would try to go after a smaller set of market failures, where the welfare cost of the free market outcome is particularly large, and where the state capacity required in addressing the market failure is relatively small. Given our capacity constraints today, to quote Kaushik Basu, we have to engage in ‘libertarianism of necessity’.<br>“When state capacity is low, there is a greater chance of making mistakes. In this case, the damage that can be caused by a more intrusive action by the state is greater.”<br>“When we live in a low-state-capacity environment, there is a greater chance that the government is wrong. In this case, we should favour small moves, small powers for the government, small punishments, small sums of money. The bigger and more dramatic the action, the greater is the harm inflicted upon society when government is wrong.”<br><br>There is a lot to gain by paring down to a smaller set of priorities, focusing upon them, and making genuine progress. If the scarce resources —of money and man-hours of key persons—could focus on a small set of important problems, we would get a lot more done. Along the way, we would learn how to own and operate a state.<br>The virtue of simplicity<br>Under conditions of low state capacity, If a subsidy has to be paid, it is best to do this through the expenditure programmes of government, where there will be better scrutiny of the relative magnitudes of expenditures<br>When state capacity is low, tax rates should be low, expenditures on public programmes should be low, the investigative powers of the agencies should be low and the punishments that are encoded into laws should be low. When state capacity is low, we should design simple interventions that are easy to implement. <br>The weak state has highly limited resources of money, of the time of capable staff, and the management time of the leadership. Rather than spread this widely, it makes more sense, under conditions of low state capacity, to attempt doing fewer things. How to choose these fewer things? <br>One useful test is whether there is a market failure. Many things should not be done, as they do not address market failure. The core of any state is four elements: the criminal justice system, the judiciary, tax collection and financial regulation. Without these, there can be no economy. Hence, these four areas should be the limited areas of focus. We should learn how to run a state by building capability in these four areas.<br><br>“There are two temptations that need to be avoided. The first is the pleasure of solving one small problem, The second temptation that should be avoided is the great man theory of history.<br>It is better to have a bicameral legislature, and different clocks for the selection of representatives in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, in order to avoid the possibility of a momentary infatuation of voters inducing concentration of power<br>It is better for any one industry to be answerable to many masters ranging from income tax law to competition law to sectoral regulation.

The principal should contract out everything that can be contracted out, in this fashion. After this is done, the work of the department splits into two tracks:<br>

<br>Performing, within the department, all the difficult functions which are not easy to specify, where there are political complexities, which are not mere technical problems.”

The separation of powers doctrine argues that it is better to separate legislative, executive and judicial powers across three distinct organizations. To the extent that more than one of these is brought into a single organization, there is concentration of power, which inevitably leads to abuse of power.<br>The rule of law is also a tool for achieving state capacity. When there are failures on the rule of law, this places arbitrary power in the hands of officials and politicians. This leads to abuse of power and low state capacity.<br>The third element of wisdom is about the powers of an agency. At the outset, it is important to give low powers to an agency. Government agencies should have low levels of direct and indirect coercive power. This includes the power to raid a person, the power to tap phone conversations, the power to spend money, the power to punish a person, etc. Power corrupts, and the greater the power of the personnel<br>The law that establishes an agency requires six key elements:<br>
<br>Clarity of objective: Accountability can only come about when there is clarity of purpose. Vague, multiple or conflicting objectives cater to corruption and incompetence.
<br>Formal processes for legislative functions: The law must write the due process through which the agency wields the power to write law.
<br>Formal processes for executive functions: The law must write the due process through which the agency performs executive functions like licensing and investigation. This is analogous to the role of the Criminal Procedure Code in binding the police to how they function.
<br>Formal processes for judicial functions: The law must write the due process through which the judicial functions are performed. There must be a hearing, the person conducting the proceedings must be unconflicted, orders and penalties must be reasoned, and an efficacious appeal must be possible.
<br>Reporting and accountability: The agency must release enough information about its own functioning so as to be held accountable for its use of public resources and wielding the coercive power of the state.
<br>Board: The law must write the role and structure of the board. The board must have a majority of non-government members, who must hold the management accountable; and the board must control the design of the organization. A majority of outside directors is essential in switching the strategic conversations from loyalty to voice”
<br>the bad outcomes that we see in India flow from badly drafted laws.<br><br>We have low state capacity when there is no leadership that thinks in this fashion, when the organization has a fixed budget year after year, and the organization is impervious to information. There are no feedback loops, and the organization has stopped thinking.<br><br>Formal processes, embedded in the law, are the prerequisites for wielding discretion, which is the prerequisite for state capacity.<br>When there is one practical error that has taken place in one government organization, we should generally resist the impulse of solving it. We should go deeper. Why did intelligent and well-meaning people make such a mistake? What was the structure of incentives that led them to this mistake? This leads us to the question of organization design. <br>Recruiting famous people or skilled people will not change the organization design. Building state capacity will not come out of hiring Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or non-IAS or private people. Government works better when there is dispersion of power. A great deal of failure comes from a few individuals controlling excessive power. Checks and balances are key. <br>The drafting of law involves two key elements.<br>
<br>First, law authorizes the coercion of private people.
<br>Second, the law must address the principal agent problem between the citizen and the state. An array of checks and balances must be built in, when drafting the law, in order to address public choice concerns, to create accountability mechanisms. 
<br><br>‘Agencification’ will help.<br>
Establish an organization outside the department, give it a clear objective, and hold it accountable. Departments must contract out, to such agencies, all technical functions which can be contracted out through well-specified laws.

The answer lies in establishing formal procedures with the rule of law, so that discretion is contained in checks and balances. <br><br>In India, our public policy capabilities are highly circumscribed by the unavailability of data.

The story of the global search for moral truths In this remarkable and groundbreaking book, Kenan Malik explores the history of moral thought as it has developed over three millennia, from Homer’s Greece to Mao’s China, from ancient India to modern America. It tells the stories of the great philosophers, and breathes life into their ideas, while also challenging many of our most cherished moral beliefs. Engaging and provocative, The Quest for a Moral Compass confronts some of humanity’s deepest questions. Where do values come from? Is God necessary for moral guidance? Are there absolute moral truths? It also brings morality down to earth, showing how, throughout history, social needs and political desires have shaped moral thinking. It is a history of the world told through the history of moral thought, and a history of moral thought that casts new light on global history.Extracted Annotations (11/19/2022, 4:41:57 AM)

The other Marks of Existence are anitya, or impermanence, and anatman, meaning 'no self' or 'egolessness'. Anitya expresses the belief that everything in the phenomenal world is in a state of ux. This includes human beings themselves. Hence anatman, or lack of self. All human existence, for the Buddha, is a series of discontinuous moments. The image he presents is of a row of unlit candles. The rst candle is lit, used to light the second, but is itself then extinguished; and so on it continues down the row. Human existence, too, consists of a series of moments, lit up and snued out. Each moment of consciousness gives birth to the next and then ceases to be, so no person is constant from one moment to the next.

Originally a place of bliss, the world had been reduced to a place of suering by human capitulation to desire, a sentiment that was, half a millennium later, to be echoed in certain strands of Christian thought, though in Buddhism the cause of degradation is not sin, as in Christianity, but ignorance. Suering can only be ended through renunciation of all desire, the third of the Noble Truths. Renunciation of desire is the path to nirvana, or liberation from rebirth, the Buddhist version of the Hindu idea of moksha. Like Hindus, Buddhists believe in the cycle of birth, death and rebirth in a new form that is the inevitable burden of human life. Only through enlightenment - moksha or nirvana - can one break that endless cycle. What rebirth means when one does not possess a self, and when every individual's life lacks continuity from one moment to the next, let alone from one birth to the next, is a conundrum that Buddhists have endlessly debated, and upon which arguments have endlessly foundered."

These include the acceptance of the Four Noble Truths; the resolve to live according to the Buddhist way; the wisdom to adopt the right kind of livelihood, rejecting, for instance, jobs that involve killing, such as being a butcher, a hunter or a soldier; and the determination to act ethically by avoiding stealing, prohibited sexual activity, unjust speech and intoxicating drinks."

Both Mo and Hobbes saw humans, in the state of nature prior to the creation of society, as living in a condition of constant warfare. But where Hobbes saw conict as arising out of the untrammelled pursuit of self-interest, Mo saw it as the consequence of discord over values.

The Mahayana ideal is the bodhisattva, or 'enlightened being', who has gained enlightenment but voluntarily postpones his or her nal entry into nirvana until everyone else has also become enlightened. The arhat seeks only his liberation, the bodhisattva the liberation of all. In Theravada only monks can achieve buddhahood; in Mahayana all can potentially do so. It is a more social gospel, evincing greater compassion for the poor and the needy. For Mahayanas, compassion ranked equally with wisdom as a means of achieving salvation. More exible about the demands of scripture, more willing to adapt the Buddha's teachings to local sensitivities, more attuned to social needs, it was unsurprisingly Mahayana Buddhism that travelled better beyond the boundaries of India.

They came to hold extraordinary power in shaping the beliefs and practices of the Muslim community. The ulama wielded its power in a dierent way to Christian clergy. In Christianity, faithfulness was dened primarily through correct belief, hence the fractious debates and schisms over doctrines such as the divinity of Christ and the nature of the Trinity. Belief is clearly important within Islam, too, but faithfulness is dened less by right belief than by correct practice. It is a distinction between what philosophers call orthodoxic and orthopraxic faiths. The one and only belief required of a convert to Islam is simple - 'There is no god but God, and Muhammad is God's messenger'.

The most celebrated of the freethinkers was Abul Ala al-Ma'arri (c973-1058), sometimes known as the Eastern Lucretius for his uninching religious scepticism: They all err—Moslems, Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians: Humanity follows two world-wide sects: One, man intelligent without religion, The second, religious without intellect.5 Born in Syria, al-Ma'arri was struck down at an early age by smallpox, which was eventually to lead to blindness. He is one of the greatest poets in the Arab tradition. His most famous work, The Epistle of Forgiveness, in which he describes visiting paradise and meeting Arab poets of the pagan period, bears comparison to Dante's Divine Comedy. Not Revelation, nor tradition nor authority but only reason, alMa'arri insisted, should guide human life: Traditions come from the past, of high import if they be True; Ay, but weak is the chain of those who warrant their truth. Consult thy reason and let perdition take others all: Of all the conference Reason best will counsel and guide.

The ultimate goal of the seeker of truth was the pure beatic experience that comes with the annihilation of the self and its absorption into God. Reading Su literature, al-Ghazali writes in his autobiography, made him realize that both theological convictions and good deeds were by themselves insucient for gaining redemption in the afterlife.

Since there was no point in designing rules of conduct to get humans into the next world, such rules could reect the needs of this one. Hence the Reformation created the possibility of a secular space dened by laws that defended political rather than divine order. It was an argument that clearly appealed to monarchs and princes chang at the constraints imposed by Papal power. By the thirteenth century the Church had achieved an unprecedented level of political authority in Western Europe. It was also riddled with corruption, shot through with sleaze, and had become a machine for minting money and grasping power. In 1492 Pope Alexander VI, a member of the Borgia family, had artfully bribed his way to the Papacy, despite having several mistresses and at least seven known illegitimate children. Forty years earlier, Duke Amadeus VIII of Savoy had managed to get his eight-year-old son appointed as the Bishop of Geneva. If the higher clergy were lacking in any sense of moral virtue, the lower clergy were of ten illiterate, uncouth and ignorant. Little wonder that huge resentments had built up against Papal power. The so-called 'magisterial Protestantism', the Protestant rebellion led by the elite, swept through much of Northern and Central Europe, from the Swiss cantons, and the German-speaking lands of the Holy Roman Empire, to Bohemia, Poland and the Baltic states to the east and through the Netherlands to England to the north."

When Descartes writes that 'I' did this or that, he does so in a much more modern sense - as a personal reection on his thoughts and the workings of his own mind. The Discourse is written almost as a narrative, with Descartes himself as the hero, in search of the Holy Grail of truth. With Descartes the mind became fully interior and the private possession of the individual. If human beings were thinking substances, nature was a machine. This was the second principle that permeated the work of Descartes. It was a view in direct contrast to that of Aristotle, for whom the cosmos was more like an organism than a machine. In the new philosophy articulated by Descartes the teleological view of nature was banished. The Aristotelian universe, full of purpose and desire, gave way to an inert universe composed of purposeless particles each pursuing its course mindless of others.

To police the covenant, people transfer their rights, save that of self-defence, to a central power that ensures that no one reneges on their agreement to limit their own rights, and is able to enforce law by punishment. This central authority Hobbes calls the Commonwealth. The supreme ruler is himself not party to the covenant and so is incapable of breaching it. Such a sovereign is the source of law and property rights in the new society, and it is his function to enforce the covenant and protect his subjects. Hobbes accepted that the supreme power could be an 'Assembly of men' or of 'one Man'. But even an assembly would be no democracy. The power of the ruler, whether an individual or an assembly, had to be absolute. The only liberty a subject possessed was the liberty to do anything not regulated by the sovereign. Even in society, however, the right of every individual to self-preservation is absolute. If the sovereign threatens this right to self-preservation, then the subject had 'the Liberty to disobey'.

This distinction, Israel suggests, was to shape the attitudes of the two sides to a whole host of social and political issues such as equality, democracy and colonialism. The mainstream's intellectual timidity constrained, in Israel's view, its critique of old social forms and beliefs. By contrast, the Radical Enlightenment 'rejected all compromise with the past and sought to sweep away existing structures entirely'. The Radicals were driven to pursue their ideas of equality and democracy to their logical conclusions because, having broken with traditional concepts of a God-ordained order, there was no 'meaningful alternative&nbsp; ...&nbsp; to grounding morality, political and social order on a systematic radical egalitarianism extending across all frontiers, class barriers and horizons'.

 <br>Raising revenue is hardest job<br>most important public revenue is taxation<br>tax - disincentives <br>Earlier - canons of taxation - focus<br><br>
<br>
focus on distortions<br>
economy is in a pareto equilibrium without tax<br>
tax disturbs the equilibrium<br>
second best - minimise the distortion<br>
Some say market is already distorted and the tax system must be distorted to undo the distortion. 

<br>
Much less consensus on Haig - Simsons Comprehensive income tax<br>
Earlier - Comprehensive income tax is least distortion<br>
they say indirect tax is bad - distort relative prices ..<br>
changes excess burden of indirect taxation.

<br>any indirect tax bring wedge between producer price and consumer price<br>
and direct tax wedge between work and leisure <br>high tax on capital → capital is mobile and capital will leave and loose employment..<br>
natural resources that do not go away - those can be taxed. Otherwise prefer value added tax over tax on capital.<br>in open economy tax on capital can become a tax on labour<br>
<br>
Steep progressivity for redistribution is no longer fashionable<br>
tax is not a tool for equality.. high tax on high income etc do not work 

<br>
fairness in tax policy is not to be judged from individual taxes but the tax system as a whole

<br>
shifting balance towards GST<br>
GST or value added tax ..<br>
all OECD other than US have VAT.<br>
In India the final point sale do not pay tax - mostly unorganised sector - so collection at multiple stages<br>
.<br>
in USA final point of sale happens mostly in formal - so identical tax is collected as final consumption tax.<br>
.<br>
a good organised retail economy is needed<br>
but tax collection is missed .. the entire chain is broken.<br>
America collect at the last stage 

<br>Optimal Direct - avoid having high tax rate<br>
Optimal Indirect - least distorting tax is one in which reduction in demand across commodities due to rise in price due to tax is proportionate - excess burden is less.<br>
Price elasticity - this says tax food grains very heavily and cosmetics very less.<br>
but high elasticity also have high income people…<br>
So this is not used.<br>
Also, need to calculate for multiple peple <br><br>Reduce the three costs<br>
Cost of Collection<br>
Cost of Compliance<br>
Distortion Cost <br>
<br>
Broaden the base, reduce the rate, reduce rate differences

<br>
avoid multiple objectives to evolve a simple tax system<br>
multiple objectives complicate - exceptions reate evasion

<br>
tax policy can make very little impact on changing income distribution. 

<br>
Shift focus to poverty alleviation on the expenditure side. 

<br>
a broad base tax like GST / VAT.<br>
when u reduce tariffs - income reduces - tariff is easy to collect.<br>
IMF asks to reduce tariff and how to make up? implement GST. 

<br>
responsive tax administration is an integral part of reform.<br>
trust the tax payer<br>
use information system and technology<br>
tax administration is tax policy 

<br>
Proper coordination in tax refrorms among different levels of government 

<br><br>in india - constitution - fragmented taxation<br>
state can levy tax on agriculture and they refuse to. ]]></description><link>sources\courses\emerging-issues-in-public-finance-and-taxation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">sources/Courses/Emerging Issues in Public Finance and Taxation.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 20:33:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[webinar 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Good Intentions ≠ Good Policy
<br>Theory of Change failures masquerade as implementation failures

<br>Input - Output - Outcome mapping


<br>Not good or bad, think in terms of better or worse outcome
<br>Correlation is not causation
<br>One rupee of government spending costs 3 rupees to the society 
<br>Politics is the art of possible
<br>Economics is the study of scarcity 
<br>Evidence based policy making - change needed as per evolving evidence
<br><br>a large part of policy analysis is about identifying causalities for social phenomena in highly ambiguous situations and under severe time constraints. Moreover, control of variables that affect a social phenomena is also not possible for a policy analyst.<br>Causality should be concluded only when empirical evidence proves that change in one variable is a necessary condition for the change in the other, i.e. the change in the second variable can by no means be explained without the variation in the first variable.<br><br>An empirical analysis relies only on experiments and validated measurement tools before arriving at conclusions.<br><br>the narrative approach where the historian uses imagination and knowledge of the past to construct a coherent story out of fragments of data. The disadvantage of such an approach is that it suffers from cognitive biases like bias against randomness and bias towards consistency <br>The scientist proposes a hypothesis, then tests this hypothesis by the collection and statistical analysis of data on many instances of the phenomenon in question. Even then, causality cannot be proved beyond all possible doubt. The scientist seeks to disprove a hypothesis, not to confirm it. A hypothesis is accepted only when it can not be rejected. And even after this, the theory formed 3 lacks in certitude ­ all that the scientist can conclude is that according to the current state of knowledge that is available for him/her, the hypothesis holds true. The assumption that it cannot be disproved in the future by an advancement in technology or the application of new fundamental laws is non­scientific in nature.<br>The ideal approach is to be a scientist while analysing a policy hypothesis and to be a historian while making a marketing pitch for one’s theory<br>IDEOLOGICAL BLINDERS<br>
Policy analysts operate in the political space which is inundated with ideologies of various hues. To remain non­partisan in politics is then the toughest task a policymaker faces.<br>BUREAUCRATIC BLINDERS<br>
Another fallacy to be wary of stems from our inertia to resist changing the way a problem is tackled.<br>HOPE vs DESPAIR<br>
A policy analyst needs to be dispassionate. Perspectives of hope and despair are inherent to the human way of thinking. However, policies originating from either of these perspectives lead to erroneous recommendations. <br>ETHICS IN PUBLIC POLICY<br>
Ethical dilemmas are constant features of policy making. Professionals, both in public advocacy and public policy face ethical questions on a regular basis. Ethical dilemmas in public policy arise for two reasons:<br>
resources are inadequate to meet all demands, and<br>
people are biased towards differing values and ideas about ‘doing the right thing<br>there are two possible stances that policy analysts and advocates can take: One, to deflect the moral decision making to someone else by arguing that any viewpoint, ethical or unethical, needs to be respected and presented, and that it is the duty of the political establishment to decide what’s right and what’s wrong. At the other end, the approach is to reject projects that violate one’s sense of ‘right and wrong’.<br>It is our stand that ethics in policy making is a ‘categorical imperative’ ­ a concept which Immanuel Kant eloquently describes as an absolute, unconditional requirement that must be obeyed in all circumstances and is justified as an end in itself<br><br>
<br>Ethical professionalism is the bedrock of credibility in policy making
<br>For non­ethical questions, think in terms of better or worse and not good or bad.
<br>Approach policy problems with humility and lack of certitude
<br>Policy problems can inflame passions. Dispassionate policymaking leads to objectivity.
<br>The plural of anecdotes is not data ­ policy must rely on empiricism and not anecdotes or ideologies.

Market failures come in four kinds:<br>
<br><a data-href="Externalities" href="\notes\externalities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Externalities</a>,
<br><a data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="\notes\asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asymmetric Information</a>,

<br><a data-href="Public goods" href="\notes\public-goods.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Public goods</a>
<br>"Externalities are the situations where persons impact upon each other in ways that are not intermediated through voluntary agreements between these persons, where people impact upon each other in ways that were not negotiated." <br>"Whether positive or negative, externalities involve gains or harms that are imposed upon bystanders, which do not directly feed back upon decision makers through the normal market process" <br>"A high degree of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Asymmetric Information" data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="\notes\asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">asymmetric information</a> can create conditions under which voluntary or market-based transactions become infeasible" <br>"Market power is found when a few firms achieve a dominant position in a market."<br>“public goods such as clean air are underproduced by the free market.”<br>“public goods are things that are ‘<a data-href="non-rival" href="\non-rival" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">non-rival</a>’ and ‘<a data-href="Non-Excludable" href="\notes\non-excludable.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Non-Excludable</a>’.”<br> Excludability is essential for firms to obtain a revenue stream”<br>“The free market does not, on its own, solve these four kinds of problems. The interventions by the state should be primarily located around these four problems.”<br>When market failure is not present, we should be sceptical about state intervention<br>All activities of the state are grounded in coercion: either<br>
<br>directly (The state can demand certain behaviour, and threaten violence against private persons who refuse to comply.) or 
<br>indirectly (The state can demand tax payments from the populace, backed by threats of violence against people who do not comply).”
<br>Private persons overproduce things that impose negative <a data-href="Externalities" href="\notes\externalities.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Externalities</a> as pollution and underproduce things that impose positive externalities;<br>
modifications to tax rates can help improve the outcome. <br>The state can choose to spend tax revenues in two ways. <br>
<br>It can run state organizations such as the police, which produce certain public goods. 
<br>Or, it can transfer money to private persons All states do some amount of redistribution
<br>For example, relief work done by the government after a natural disaster is a case of transferring the money obtained in coercive ways (through taxation) from the populace to the affected people.” Subsidies can be unconnected to externalities; they can be pure redistribution.”<br>These transfers can be linked to market failure (e.g., using education vouchers to address the externalities in education) or they can be pure redistribution<br>
“The world of public policy is about these three levers: rules about behaviour, taxation, and spending money.”
<br>The state is supposed to be a machine that converts coercive power into human welfare. A coercive agent is poorly placed at solving failures of negotiation.<br>The essence of market failure is the channels of influence between two persons which are not governed by negotiations and choice: <br>
<br>Market power: One party in the negotiation has little power and experiences a loss of choice.
<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Asymmetric Information" data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="\notes\asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Asymmetric information</a>: The process of negotiation works poorly as there is a lack of information.
<br>Externalities: There are channels of influence between two parties that are not negotiated.
<br>Public goods: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.”
<br>The state is a coercive agent. At the heart of market failure is a failure of coordination, of a lack of negotiation. There is a tension at the core, where problems of coordination are not easily solved through the tool of coercion. <br>Some people might like to have a paternalistic government. Coercive power gives the state the ability to take from one and give to another, and this will make some people happy at the expense of others.  State paternalism can then only be in favour of some and not all.<br><br>People respond to incentives. Human behaviour is not fixed; it changes when the incentives change. When policy changes, human behaviour changes.<br>Politicians and officials also respond to incentives<br>A government organization that is riven with corruption is not one which was unlucky to get a lot of corrupt people. It is one where the rules of the game facilitate corruption.”<br>The task of public policy research is to identify the formal rules which have incentive implications for the behaviour of officials and politicians. When the rules change, the culture will change. Politicians and officials respond to incentives. This has a big and optimistic implication. Changes in the rules of the game will generate behavioural changes on politicians and officials also. The behaviour of politicians and officials is also malleable. The puzzle of policy design is that of finding the checks and balances, and the rules of the game, through which politicians and officials will generate good outcomes for society when they pursue their own self interest.<br><br>When 'high-powered incentives’ are set up, the agent single mindedly focuses on achieving that measure, and sacrifices everything else.<br>This proves to be particularly important when transplanting ideas from advanced economies into India<br><br>
When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. Goodhart’s law, 1975
<br><a href=".?query=tag:CharlesGoodhart" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#CharlesGoodhart</a><br><br>“Liberalism—the respect for the values, beliefs and decisions of others—is integral to economics as it is to no other branch of human knowledge.”<br>While human beings mostly do well in understanding incentives and doing the best for themselves, the new field of ‘behavioural economics’ has documented many kinds of mistakes that human beings make in understanding information, risk and time.<br><br>In practice, obtaining and processing information is costly. Humans are rational in choosing where to expend such effort<br><br>The field of behavioural economics has emphasized that humans seem to exhibit a very low regard for events deep in the future. There is a certain kind of short-termism that is wired into us; we tend to make decisions based on outcomes nearby in time.<br>These concerns have gone from novel criticism of the mainstream, with the ‘bounded rationality’ of Herbert Simon of the 1950s, to becoming the mainstream, with the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. <br>The optimal stance of policy is not obtained if we think of human beings as perfectly effective at understanding information and making sound decisions.”<br><br><br>Rules of Public Policy<br>
<br>Supply and demand make the price,
<br>Demand curves slope downward and supply curves slope upward,
<br>There is a law of one price,
<br>The policymaker should have no opinion on the price, and no tools to directly control it.”
<br>A gap between supply and demand is a problem. Prices move in order to remove imbalances between supply and demand. The movement in price solves this problem by inducing changes in both supply and demand. Every time a government interferes in the movement of a price, it hampers this adjustment process.<br>When the price goes up, less is demanded (‘demand curves slope downward’). When the price goes up, more is supplied (‘supply curves slope upward’). People are rational and change their behaviour. At a higher price, there is more supply and less demand.<br>Policymakers of a socialist vintage are hostile to the word arbitrage. However, arbitrage is the basic human instinct of removing the difference between two different prices for the same thing, and earning a profit while doing this.<br>The correct price is the one made by supply and demand, untrammelled with political influences. <br>
The market is not an invention of capitalism. It has existed for centuries. It is an invention of civilization. - <a href=".?query=tag:MikhailGorbachev" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#MikhailGorbachev</a>
<br>Controls on prices are illegitimate and do not work.<br>“How do we break out of the cobweb model (decisions made based on past data)? <br>Storage (also called ‘hoarding’) is the technique through which goods are transported from a time point where they are cheap to a time point where they are expensive. Futures trading looks into the future, and produces a forecasted price at the harvest date which can be used for sowing decisions or storage decisions. Free trade (within India and across the border) generates arbitrage, where cheap goods are taken away and additional supply brought in when prices are high.”<br><br>
<br>warehousing
<br>futures trading,
<br>domestic trade and
<br>international trade
<br>The best functioning economy is one in which changes in supply and demand rapidly result in a change in the price<br>Supply and demand make the price. When prices go up, demand goes down. When prices go up, supply goes up. Free men and women will buy things where they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive, and thus arbitrage away pricing discrepancies. When there are large changes in a price in a short time, this can be disconcerting and impose problems upon some people. But if the government forces the price to change slowly, this makes things worse.<br>Prices are the mechanism through which the market economy adjusts to shocks; by hindering price movement we postpone adjustment. In India, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary have all repeatedly undertaken actions which go against the grain of the price system. These actions are doomed to failure. When the policymaker tries to control the price, this is harmful, and the greatest harm is done when the policymaker tries to control both the price and the quantity. The policymaker should have no opinion on prices and not try to control prices. Policymakers must strengthen their intuition into the working of the price system, and go with the grain. The field of public policy is about identifying and addressing market failure, not controlling prices.<br><br><br>Competition pushes firms to cut costs, to innovate, and to deliver the best bargains for customers.<br>All across the economy, we require a progressive outlook supporting entry and competition. Policymakers must constantly use the power of the state to prise open closed systems, to create conditions of extreme competition, and to see the bright side of firm failure. <br><br>The prolonged survival of a weak firm, based on artificial life support, induces negative externalities upon healthy firms. The exit of these ‘zombie firms’ is a positive for the economy. <br>For this to work properly, we require a well-functioning bankruptcy process. In this, the key distinction is between firms with valuable organizational capital and those without.<br>The lingering presence of these firms increases the cost of Inputs for healthy firms, and reduces the profitability of healthy firms. When a policy framework encourages the lingering survival of failed firms, this harms healthy firms in that sector.<br>This is one reason why public sector companies are a problem for the economy: there is a greater risk of them becoming zombie firms backed by the exchequer. This is bad for public finance and bad for the economy.<br>Economic dynamism requires closure. When business failure turns into investigations, there is no closure.<br>A society that pillories entrepreneurs, and turns business failure into protracted disputes or entanglement in agencies, is one which will have less entrepreneurship.<br><br> Consider a future date when the bankruptcy process works well. Under such conditions, when a business cycle downturn commences, weak firms will go into the bankruptcy process and get rapidly processed, their swift exit will improve profit margins of the survivors, and the resource reallocation will generate GDP growth. Faster that this process can play out, the shorter the downturn will be. A sound bankruptcy process gives less severe business cycle downturns”<br>The Indian economy features the coexistence of high-productivity firms that abide by laws with low-productivity firms that violate laws. When law enforcement improves, and weak firms exit, GDP growth will be obtained through reallocation of labour and capital. <br><br>Market power results in bad outcomes, regardless of whether the actor in question is public or private. We should be as zealous about dismantling state-induced barriers to competition as we are when attacking market power created by private persons.<br>Creative destruction is not alien to India: for small firms, it is the everyday reality. It is only with the large firms, and the areas connected with government, where competitive dynamics is poor.”<br>

The classical economists always assumed a state of employment in the economy. The normal situation in an economy, according to them was full employment equilibrium. Less than full employment, they believed, was an abnormal situation.<br>
..<br>
There is surplus labour - wages will decrease - more hiring - full employment<br>
..<br>
savings and investment imbalance - more savings than investment - interest rates will declines - as it declines - marginal efficiency of capital vs rate of interest - low rates make it profitable to invest <br><br>reduction in government spending will not be offset by private saving so interest rate in increased and adversely affects growth<br>
fiscal deficits raise lifetime consumption by shifting taxes to the future generation<br><br>market adjustment as per Say’s law does not happen..<br>

downward rigidity for both interest rate and wages.  <br>Hence the general equilibrium is unemployment - government has to come in and create demand..<br>only when aggregate demand increases - more investment - more consumption - more demand for good - more employment - more income generated <br>Productivity is not important for government spending<br>
deficit and debt - functional finance - how will u finance it? create money supply<br><br>inc in govt expenditure enhances aggregate demand and will increase output ad employment through the multiplier.<br>
When expansion is financed through bonds, increase in interest rate may partially offset the multiplier, but increase in aggregate demand increase private investment profitability. <br>Lerner<br>
no impact only bond holders paying tax<br><br><a href=".?query=tag:MiltonFriedman" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#MiltonFriedman</a> <br><br>but increase in money supply will NOT result in increase in income and employment it only results in increase in prices because there are rigidities.  <br>So as the economy approaches the full amount of employment level any additional spending or money supply..<br>

When volume of transaction does not increase and money supply increases price will increase<br>So do this in depression and recession <br>trade off between and employment and price rise<br>
invariably money supply will cause inflation<br>When there is recession government has to act and increase aggregate demand and when economy improves government must withdraw. <br><br>Opportunity cost of saving - money removed from the system when government borrows - and if the money is not invested productively.. high impact.  <br>

<br>Why not private finance? Why public finance?<br>
to ask a question on public finance is to ask a question on government <br>Role of state - what should they so<br>
<br>some think govt is a social guardian.. maximise welfare
<br>few want the government to keep low not interfere
<br>Also when we want govt to do something . can it do something?<br>a view - <a data-href="Public Choice Theory" href="\notes\public-choice-theory.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Public Choice Theory</a><br>
Government is a necessary evil.. market does not do everything so govt is needed but confine government to only things that market can not do <br>public finance comes in when the government starts spending.. they are spending on public services and those can not be charged.. hence enforcement of taxes… when tax is inadequate and then government borrows… <br>so public spending - expense is starting point <br>when government borrow - it has opportunity cost, money has to be repaid - intergenerational equity question  <br>then spending - since certain decisions can not be made from central place - need federalism<br><br>Why government exist? what should they do?<br>Anarchy, Dictatorship &amp; Democracy<br>
provide basic public good required to enable the market to fuction<br>
- ensuring safety and security of the people<br>
- enforcing contracts<br>
- maintaining law &amp; order<br>
these can not be provided by the market<br><br>non rival in consumption - indivisible &amp; 
non excludable - free riding 
people do not reveal their preference  - prices can not be charged no demand curve - no prices can be charged.. enforce charges - taxes - compulsory payment in the form of taxes - tax regime
public goods entail free riding 
Copy<br><br>Underprovisioned by the market - only the private benefit is equated to private cost and social benefi is ignored <br>Why government provide education?<br>
Market failure in redistribution - so government can do redistribution. no more intervention. <br>Concept of merit goods - there is no limit <br>solution to oligopoly is not government take over but regulation<br>ownership - public finance is needed - provision of public service<br>
vs<br>
regulation - public finance is not involved <br>public service depends on the idea of role of state <br>not all areas of market failure require public finance <br>logic of collective action - government can spend only if there is need for collective action <br>Voluntary action in large groups do not happen <br><br>(theory of public goods)<br>Allocation of resources b/w public and private goods<br>
redistribution (of cash) - subsidisation of a commodity / service is bad as compared to cash transfer<br>
Stabilisation - economy moves in cycle<br>
Classicists feel employment is always full ..<br>
Keynesian - in cycle the general equilibrium is unemployment<br>
hence a role for government to spend to create aggregate demand and create employment.<br>
After full employment - any further expense will cause inflation<br>
tradeoff btw unemplyment and inflation<br>
rigidity in wage.. interest rate → classical do not work<br>
marginal efficiency of capital vs rate of interest<br>
Counter cyclical policy<br>Redistribution - predominantly by centre <br>progressive tax base like -personal income tax corporate tax must be by centre <br>Stabilisation - predominantly by the centre - you can not have more than one money supplying authority <br>Education, healthcare, water supply n sanitation, law n order → predominantly state <br>which level of government has what advantage in each of this function and allocate<br><br>7-8% of GDP as fiscal deficit <br>Introduction of TIN.. TDS tracking led to increase in direct tax growth <br>Revenue Deficit<br>
fiscl deficit<br>
primary deficit - deficit entered to in the current year<br><br><br>Ability of tax system to reduce inequality is minimum<br>
inequality can improve if income of both rich and poor come down and the income of rich come down faster than that of the poor.<br>
but the poor does not have a cushion<br>
so the focus of equity should be abolition of poverty rather than reduction of inequality<br>
if abolition of poverty is the goal, the instrument should be the expenditure side of the budget.<br>
if we use tax exemption as a tool, rich is also benefitted and in relative term the poor might get benefitting more but in absolute term rich may be benefitting more<br>
so no need to have a massive exception list<br><br>
<br>broaden the base<br>
have minimum exemptions - 
<br>Reduce Rates<br>
high tax - tax evasion / tax avoidance became legitimate 
<br>Reduce rate differences
<br>simple predictable and transparent tax system
<br>In India tax GDP ratio is much below the potential <br>
<br>agricultural tax
<br>multiple objective for tax 

<br>Equity
<br>incentive for saving 
<br>insurance
<br>small scale industries, SEZ, 
<br>infra investment 
<br>NE State
<br>accelerated depreciation<br>
You go on narrowing the tax base<br>
complex tax system 


<br><br>no difference btw indirect and direct tax regressive and progressive tax<br>
indirect tax wedge between producer and consumer prices<br>
direct tax a wedge between work and leisure <br>the extension of distortion you create os square of the tax rate<br><br>Administrative<br>
Compliance<br>
Distortion<br><br>Deficit<br>
The total money available for borrowing is provided by the household savings.<br>
Govt n Corporate are net borrowers. Surplus only with the household.<br>
Only house holders save in both physical n financial asset.  only the financial asset is available for borrowing.<br>more borrowing - crowding out effect<br>
if the money is not used for productive use - inter generational equity question.<br>
more borrowing - more rate<br>
credit rating <br>Message from the book<br>
- State intervention - prism of opportunity cost<br>
- State intervention ONLY when markets fail<br>
- state intervention need not entail public spending. Public spending only when public service is provided<br>
- State intervention complementary to market function<br>
- have important role in human development - in populous country - Externality<br>
- technology has changed the nature of public goods so review of states role from time to time - electricity, telecom, natural monopolies<br>
- provision of public services does not require production<br>
- focus should be on outcomes and not outlays<br>
- high mobility of capital and capital embodied labour has limited the capacity to tax them. The tax on capital might turn out to be a tax on labour (unemployment) in open economies. equity should be pursued more through the expenditure side of the budget<br>
- Political economy considerations reduce the time horizon in policy making. Preference for borrowing transfers the burden to the unenfranchised. Financial repression.<br>
- Redistribution is better done through cash transfer rather than subsidization<br>
- need to consider the general equilibrium effects of tax and expenditure policies in calibrating the budgetary policy<br>
lesser demand for car due to high tax will affect the upstream labour, downstream service etc]]></description><link>sources\courses\overview.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">sources/Courses/Overview.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Aug 2024 22:35:20 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rhythms in writing]]></title><description><![CDATA[

“You gain comprehensiveness as you climb the ladder but you lose the ability to form concrete images. But you’ve traded specificity for something that also has value. If you can generalize about a larger class, you have knowledge that you can apply in a variety of situations so greater meaning resides on the ladder’s upper rungs. Good writing constantly ascends and descends the ladder of abstraction.” - Storycraft, Jack Hart
<br>Consider a ladder . Just as the ladder rests on solid ground, the bottom of the ladder of abstraction represents&nbsp;concrete things:<br>
<br>peanut butter and jam sandwiches
<br>your goldfish Harry
<br>a 2011 Honda Civic painted “tango red pearl”
<br>broken leg bones
<br>velcro straps on winter jackets
<br>fresh loaves of rye bread right out of the oven
<br>kisses from your mother
<br>Conversely, the top of the ladder of abstraction is for abstract ideas and concepts:<br>
<br>democracy
<br>freedom
<br>justice
<br>wealth
<br>truth
<br>The middle rungs of the ladder store things which are not entirely concrete, and yet not entirely abstract:<br>
<br>livestock
<br>educational institutions
<br>classical music
<br>organizational charts
<br>To be an effective speaker, you must “climb up and down the ladder of abstraction” to borrow a phrase Roy Peter Clark uses in <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316014990/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316014990&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=6mcite-20" rel="noopener" class="external-link" title="Examine book details" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316014990/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0316014990&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=6mcite-20" target="_blank"><em></em></a>Writing Tools: 50 Essential Strategies for Every Writer. Audiences need both concrete details and abstract principles and lessons. To make a persuasive argument and establish a powerful rhythm, balance your speech between the two. Move up and down the ladder (and spend some time in the middle, if appropriate), making your message more understandable for the audience at many different levels.<br><br>If your speeches or presentations have too much theory and highly abstract concepts, you can achieve balance by injecting content at a low level of abstraction. Here are a few ways to do this:<br>
<br>Embrace the phrase “For example…” .<br>
Provide real-world tangible examples for your theories and ideas.
<br>Use sensory language.<br>
Help your audience see, touch, hear, taste, and smell.
<br>Be specific.<br>
Provide ample details.
<br>Tell stories and anecdotes.<br>
Stories add emotion and realism to any theory.
<br>Cite data, statistics, and case studies.<br>
They offer support for your theories.
<br>Feature photographs and props.<br>
Remember that all words are a higher level of abstraction compared to the real thing. Use the real thing.
<br>Have a strong&nbsp;call-to-action.<br>
Show your audience how to put your message into practice.
<br>Answer “How?” questions.<br>
Questions like “How does this work?” force you to more concrete explanations.
<br><br>If your speeches tend to get lost in the details, climb up the ladder periodically. Here are a few strategies you can use to get there:<br>
<br>Answer “Why is this important?”<br>
Give the deeper meaning behind the concrete facts and data.
<br>Provide the big picture.<br>
Explain the context and orient your audience.
<br>Reveal patterns and relationships.<br>
Help your audience see how the ideas connect — both to other ideas and their lives.
<br>Draw diagrams.<br>
Help your audience form mental models of processes, objects, etc.
<br>Use appropriate charts.<br>
Go beyond pure data to show trends.
<br>Reveal the lesson.<br>
Follow every story or case study with the key insights.
<br>Draw inferences.<br>
Apply sound logic to generalize from particular cases.
<br>Summarize into principles and guidelines.<br>
Help the audience learn from your experience by providing principles they can use.
<br>Appeal to shared ideals.<br>
Draw connections between your message and the ideals held by your audience, such as justice, truth, liberty, or freedom<br>

 <br>What can the history of Morality tell about nature of morality and about human beings?<br>Nitche<br>
enforcing power morality is an expression of power<br>
power assertion of morality<br>
declared God is dead<br>
Christianity infected the healthy body of civilisation with a poison of compassion<br>
The malice of the modern world lay in a morality that defended the weak and docile and deprecated the aristocratic and the strong<br>
the strongest and evil sprit done the most for the advancement of humanity<br>
amorality - rejection of god<br>Argument for religion / theism: without religion there is no anchor for moral truth. values become a matter of personal preference or political need<br>
individual had to pick and choose ones values. <br>even gods views are not universally accepted.<br>
jihadis moderates and liberals read the same book and interpret is in different ways.. so brining their own values..<br>
this is true of monotheistic and non-monotheistic faith..<br>As societies changes.. so do moral values and believers interpretations of god’s will. <br>Religious  injunctions may appear absolute and inviolable… but how humans understood them changed with time <br>The Moral Landscape: How Science Can Determine Human Values is a 2010 book by Sam Harris<br>
Values are in essence facts about the world and must be studied by science in particular neuroscience.. science will decide which is right. <br>moral certainties anchoring in something beyond us?<br>how man is and how man could be<br>
3 major historic shift<br>
<br>axiol age.. 1000-2000 BCE<br>
morality arise from structure of the community - the structure that is given<br>
faith a social reality and there was no evading it..<br>
human life defined by inevitability of death and universality of sorrow and suffering<br>
how to define right and with within structure of society<br>
everyone had a fixed position in society.. it defined their role and duties<br>
morality was wisdom and reason 
<br>monotheistic<br>
idea of human dignity takes<br>
humans - rational being<br>
changed the relationship btw humans and freewill<br>
agency of will - all humans are tainted<br>
morality made rule bound - god is the end and means was known<br>
individual - related to community 
<br>the coming of modernity<br>
Emanuel Kant<br>
communities n social structure changed.<br>
religion &amp; morality separated<br>
The idea of individual.. separate from society<br>
humans are capable of acting rationally and morally without guidance from beyond<br>
death of god… fall of man (sucking out of optimism.. darker view of human nature.. 20th century)<br>
material progress do not mean moral progress<br>
Asian revolution - anti colonial movements<br>
opposition to European rule - opposition to European ideals - they had to develop their own..<br>
Separatist movements 
<br>ethics is part of life and shaped by social material..<br>
so moral arc is subjective n matter of taste?<br>he says no..<br>
moral questions have rational answers<br>earlier<br>
what actions were rational in the given society..<br>
modernity<br>
what social structure is rational <br>
<br>new forms of social conversations.. political and moral debates moved to a wider participants and not just elite. printing press and mass media.. everyone can participate in the debate.. 
<br>new social tools - democratic process.. social movements strikes liberation struggles.. enable to transform social conditions 
<br>new kind of social conversations not only within but between societies.. detached from specific social structures.. <br>questions of morality do not have objective answer as in scientific terminology.. but it is not a matter of taste alone. <br>moral values are non arbitrary… not because it is fixed in transcendental sphere or fixed objectively by science, but because it has evolved through humanity’s collective judgement and to bring reason to bear upon social and to define rational objects of moral question<br>
this requires social engagement .. breakdown of this engagement is problematic in recent times.  <br>without this people turn to god, science … an external authority to draw a moral line..<br>
nitche wrote god is dead.. but his shadow looms…<br>
god is a metaphor.. <br>Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe - trouble with death of god.. because people continue to act as if he is still alive..<br>
old methods - should or ought<br>
modernity dethroned god but Kantianism utilitarianism defined new morality as set of rules.. but they no longer had any figure.. so no proper foundation or no meaningful employment of moral concepts.. morality became incoherent. <br>We still think of morality as a rules to follow… <br>but history of morality teaches us that, every problem needs to be understood in context and to apply wisdom and experience in this context as we try to think and act morally.. <br>truth<br>
<br>scientific truth
<br>social / political truth - comes from interaction.. engagement.. in polarised world everyone has their own truth… and no engagement or working out what’s needed collectively.
<br>
<br>in europe america people talk about breakdown of post war concensus.. breakdown of populism,.. from mainstream politicians and institutions.. market forces.. has optimised societies.. social life<br>
and rise of identity politics..<br>
breakdown of social movements that embodied universal values..  (civil rights movement - equality, democracy etc)<br>
old order is coming apart.. 
<br>Inability to have conversations and see world beyond narrow group. 
<br>did language shape our understanding of morality..<br>
no.. the problems.. questions faced is common in bhudhism.. confusious and many moral schools of though.. problems with which we are confronted are<br>
our own nature<br>
other people<br>
the world we live him<br>
so all confront same kind of problem and come up with same kind of solution <br>morality in Policy making / public decision making  in india.. should constitution be north star…<br>
constitution is a framework for law.. morality and law are different<br>
immoral are legal<br>
illegal are moral <br>distinct legal question from moral question<br>
something fixed like constitution can not answer moral questions <br>moral issue require conversations -<br>
to shape a moral debate<br>
<br>principles - not rules<br>
what it means in certain context needs to be decided / debated.
<br>Open minded 
<br>any moral argument must be reasoned out - not quote a scripture or law.. it has to make a case for it ..

What objectives of public policy are appropriate?<br>

<br>Page 13
The state is the most powerful actor in society. The state has the capacity to coerce, the capacity to inflict violence upon private persons<br>

<br>Page 15
Immigration is the sincerest form of flattery, and this is where liberal democracies stand out.<br>

<br>Page 16
appreciation of ‘self-organizing systems’, of the uncoordinated decisions of individuals left to themselves, that discover order by themselves<br>

<br>Page 16
A state is a human community that (successfully) claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory. Max Weber, The Vocation Lectures, 1919<br>

<br>Page 16
at the heart of the state, there is violence. The state acquires a monopoly upon violence<br>

<br>Page 17
The individual has a soul but the state is a soulless machine. The state can never be weaned away from violence to which it owes its existence.Mahatma Gandhi<br>

<br>Page 17
The big idea of liberal democracy is to limit state violence into a controlled, predictable and just form<br>

<br>Page 17
The important thing for government is not to do things which individuals are doing already, and to do them a little better or a little worse; but to do those things which at present are not done at all.John Maynard Keynes<br>

<br>Page 18
Where the free market fails to deliver efficient economic outcomes, this is termed ‘market failure’. Market failures come in four kinds: Externalities, Asymmetric information, Market power and Public goods.<br>

<br>Page 18
Externalities are the situations where persons impact upon each other in ways that are not intermediated through voluntary agreements between these persons, where people impact upon each other in ways that were not negotiated.<br>

<br>Page 18
Whether positive or negative, externalities involve gains or harms that are imposed upon bystanders, which do not directly feed back upon decision makers through the normal market process<br>

<br>Page 19
A high degree of asymmetric information can create conditions under which voluntary or market-based transactions become infeasible<br>

<br>Page 19
Market power is found when a few firms achieve a dominant position in a market.<br>

<br>Page 19
public goods such as clean air are underproduced by the free market. I<br>

<br>Page 19
public goods are things that are ‘non-rival’ and ‘non-excludable’.<br>

<br>Page 20
It is not possible to exclude any person from the benefits. Excludability is essential for firms to obtain a revenue stream<br>

<br>Page 20
The free market does not, on its own, solve these four kinds of problems. The interventions by the state should be primarily located around these four problems.<br>

<br>Page 20
When market failure is not present, we should be sceptical about state intervention<br>

<br>Page 21
All activities of the state are grounded in coercion: either directly (when the state demands that private<br>

<br>Page 22
persons behave in certain ways) or indirectly (when the state uses threats of violence to collect tax revenues, and then spends them in certain ways).<br>

<br>Page 22
All states do some amount of redistribution. For example, relief work done by the government after a natural disaster is a case of transferring the money obtained in coercive ways (through taxation) from the populace to the affected people.<br>

<br>Page 24
Subsidies can be unconnected to externalities; they can be pure redistribution.<br>

<br>Page 25
The state can demand certain behaviour, and threaten violence against private persons who refuse to comply. The state can demand tax payments from the populace, backed by threats of violence against people who do not comply. The tax rates can vary based on the situation. Private persons overproduce things that impose negative externalities (such as pollution) and underproduce things that impose positive externalities; modifications to tax rates can help improve the outcome. The state can choose to spend tax revenues in two ways. It can run state organizations such as the police, which produce certain public goods. Or, it can transfer money to private persons. These transfers can be linked to market failure (e.g., using education vouchers to address the externalities in education) or they can be pure redistribution<br>

<br>Page 25
The world of public policy is about these three levers: rules about behaviour, taxation, and spending money.<br>

<br>Page 27
The state is supposed to be a machine that converts coercive power into human welfare<br>

<br>Page 28
A coercive agent is poorly placed at solving failures of negotiation<br>

<br>Page 28
The essence of market failure is the channels of influence between two persons which are not governed by negotiations and choice:Market power: One party in the negotiation has little power and experiences a loss of choice. Asymmetric information: The process of negotiation works poorly as there is a lack of information. Externalities: There are channels of influence between two parties that are not negotiated. Public goods: The individual is not given the opportunity to negotiate and choose.<br>

<br>Page 28
The impossibility of paternalistic policy<br>

<br>Page 29
State paternalism can then only be in favour of some and not all.<br>

<br>Page 29
The state is a coercive agent. At the heart of market failure is a failure of coordination, of a lack of negotiation. There is a tension at the core, where problems of coordination are not easily solved through the tool of coercion. Some people might like to have a paternalistic government. Coercive power gives the state the ability to take from one and give to another, and this will make some people happy at the expense of others. Paternalism by the government is an impossibility.<br>

<br>Page 33
First, there is the political economy problem, and governments are hijacked by special interest groups to aim for the wrong objectives. And then, there is the state capacity problem, where government fails to achieve the objective that it seeks to solve.<br>

<br>Page 33
Situations where freedom works well:<br>

<br>Page 33
There is a market failure, but the politics goes wrong:<br>

<br>Page 34
There is a market failure, and the objectives of policymakers were sound, but the design of the intervention was wrong:<br>

<br>Page 34
There is a market failure, the correct intervention was attempted, but the implementation failed:<br>

<br>Page 34
This four-part thinking is more useful than the more conventional classification scheme of ‘political economy problems’ versus ‘state capacity problems<br>

<br>Page 34
The three key steps in policy thinking are:1. Are we facing a market failure? If not, there is no role for the state. 2. Does the proposed intervention address this market failure? Sometimes, we see proposed solutions which do not address the claimed problem. 3. Do we have the ability to effectively implement the proposed intervention? Many times, an idea might be sound but, under present capacity constraints, the implementation of the proposed intervention may be infeasible<br>

<br>Page 35
Summing upWhen faced with a potential government intervention, it is useful to ask three key questions. Is there a market failure? Does the proposed intervention address the identified market failure? Do we have the ability to implement the proposed intervention? A disciplined approach of carefully walking through these three steps will result in improved economic policy thinking. It adds up to a powerful and non-trivial toolkit for thinking about the world. There are four classes of errors in Indian public policy that call for reform: (a) Situations where freedom works well, where the right thing for the government is to do nothing but the government is doing something; (b) A market failure is present, but the politics pointed state power in the wrong direction; (c) A market failure is present, the politics worked out right, but<br>

<br>Page 36
the wrong intervention was chosen; (d) A market failure is present, the right intervention was chosen, but the implementation was lacking. A successful political system is one which is able to navigate this minefield. It should hold back from engaging in interventions where there is no market failure. It should be able to channel democratic politics away from the traps of populism or special interest group politics. It should be able to foster expertise in understanding problems and devising the right solutions. And finally, it should have the execution capacity of translating the right idea into a successful execution.<br>

<br>Page 37
Public policy failures are born of: (1) The information constraint; (2) The knowledge constraint; (3) The resource constraint; (4) The administrative constraint; and (5) The voter rationality constraint<br>

<br>Page 37
Element 1: The information constraint<br>

<br>Page 38
What you measure is what you can manage.<br>

<br>Page 39
Element 2: The knowledge constraint<br>

<br>Page 41
Element 3: The resource constraint<br>

<br>Page 44
As a thumb rule, it is useful to reckon that the cost to society for every rupee of public spending is around Rs 3.<br>

<br>Page 45
In the best advanced economies, the numerical value for the MCPF is from 1.5 to 2.<br>

<br>Page 45
Element 4: The administrative constraint<br>

<br>Page 46
In all large organizations, there are principal–agent problems<br>

<br>Page 46
Three cross-cutting problems that are found in all organizations are human resource management, the financial process and the procurement process.<br>

<br>Page 47
In every organization, there are front-line producers and then there is an enormous overhead of monitoring, measurement, management and strategy.<br>

<br>Page 47
Politics without romance<br>

<br>Page 48
This intuition was formalized in the field of ‘Public Choice Theory’ which used economic analysis to think about the objectives of politiciansand officials<br>

<br>Page 48
The yearning for heroes<br>

<br>Page 48
The objective of reform is not to hire<br>

<br>Page 49
saints, but to achieve a state which yields good outcomes when each actor is self-interested.<br>

<br>Page 49
The fruit of the poisonous tree<br>

<br>Page 50
Who will mind the minder?<br>

<br>Page 50
Public choice theory encourages us to think that all officials and all politicians are cut from the same cloth. We have to construct systems of checks and balances, that will work through rational incentives of all parties, and without assumptions that any one person is a saint.<br>

<br>Page 51
Element 5: The voter rationality constraint<br>

<br>Page 51
Incentives of voters<br>

<br>Page 51
the average person does not have the incentive to invest in learning about<br>

<br>Page 52
policy problems<br>

<br>Page 54
Incentives, not technology<br>

<br>Page 55
In an ideal world, the state is a benevolent actor, which establishes the right priorities, and is able to marshal the resources to achieve good outcomes. This is not the world that we live in. Public policy in India is characterized by a great deal of failure. We tend to establish the wrong objectives, and then we tend to fail on achieving these objectives. What are the sources of state failure in India?1. The resource constraint: Each rupee of state expenditure in India is likely to come at a cost of Rs 3 for society. 2. The information constraint: Policymakers mostly lack high-quality data about the society in which they seek to operate. 3. The knowledge constraint: Public policy is a research process, and we in India lack the foundations of knowledge for operating this research process. 4. The administrative constraint: We fare poorly at resolving the principal–agent problem between the individual and the state. We must approach politics without romance. Politicians and officials pursue their self-interest. 5. The voter rationality constraint: Individuals lack the incentive to think about policy problems, and organize themselves to influence the policy process.<br>

<br>Page 58
People respond to incentivesHumans optimize<br>

<br>Page 59
Politicians and officials also respond to incentives<br>

<br>Page 59
A government organization that is riven with corruption is not one which was unlucky to get a lot of corrupt people. It is one where the rules of the game facilitate corruption.<br>

<br>Page 60
The task of public policy research is to identify the formal rules which have incentive implications for the behaviour of officials and politicians. When the rules change, the culture will change. Politicians and officials respond to incentives. This has a big and optimistic implication. Changes in the rules of the game will generate behavioural changes on politicians and officials also. The behaviour of politicians and officials is also malleable. The puzzle of policy design is that of finding the checks and balances, and the rules of the game, through which politicians and officials will generate good outcomes for society when they pursue their own self interest.<br>

<br>Page 61
Deploy incentives with careCaution in setting up high-powered incentives<br>

<br>Page 61
When such ‘high-powered incentives’ are set up, the agent singlemindedly focuses on achieving that measure, and sacrifices everything else.<br>

<br>Page 61
This proves to be particularly important when transplanting ideas from advanced economies into India<br>

<br>Page 62
Caution in setting up incentives around statistical measuresWhen a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.Goodhart’s law, 1975<br>

<br>Page 64
Liberalism—the respect for the values, beliefs and decisions of others—is integral to economics as it is to no other branch of human knowledge.<br>

<br>Page 64
cost of acquiring and processing information.<br>

<br>Page 65
thinking across long time horizons.<br>

<br>Page 65
they have gone from novel criticism of the mainstream, with the ‘bounded rationality’ of Herbert Simon of the 1950s, to becoming themainstream, with the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics. 6<br>

<br>Page 65
The optimal stance of policy is not obtained if we think of human beings as perfectly effective at understanding information and making sound decisions.<br>

<br>Page 65
People respond to incentives. Human behaviour is not fixed; it changes when the incentives change. When policy changes, human behaviour changes.<br>

<br>Page 66
However, changing incentives should not be done in a simplistic way. When high-powered incentives are introduced, there is the danger of individuals pursuing those incentives to the exclusion of everything else. This can often result in unintended consequences. When incentives are established based on a certain statistical measure, there is a greater risk that this measure will be tampered with. While human beings mostly do well in understanding incentives and doing the best for themselves, the new field of ‘behavioural economics’ has documented many kinds of mistakes that human beings make in understanding information, risk and time.<br>

<br>Page 67

<br>Supply and demand make the price, 2. Demand curves slope downward and supply curves slope upward, 3. There is a law of one price, 4. The policymaker should have no opinion on the price, and no tools to directly control it.<br>


<br>Page 68
A gap between supply and demand is a problem. Prices move in order to remove imbalances between supply and demand. The movement in price solves this problem by inducing changes in both supply and demand. Every time a government interferes in the movement of a price, it hampers this adjustment process.<br>

<br>Page 69
When the price goes up, less is demanded (‘demand curves slope downward’). When the price goes up, more is supplied (‘supply curves slope upward’). People are rational and change their behaviour. At a higher price, there is more supply and less demand.<br>

<br>Page 70
Policymakers of a socialist vintage are hostile to the word arbitrage. However, arbitrage is the basic human instinct of removing the difference between two different prices for the same thing, and earning a profit while doing this.<br>

<br>Page 71
the correct price is the one made by supply and demand, untrammelled with political influences.The market is not an invention of capitalism. It has existed for centuries. It is an invention of civilization.Mikhail Gorbachev<br>

<br>Page 71
Controls on prices are illegitimate and do not work.<br>

<br>Page 71
How do we break out of the cobweb model? Storage (also called ‘hoarding’) is the technique through which goods are transported from a<br>

<br>Page 72
time point where they are cheap to a time point where they are expensive. Futures trading looks into the future, and produces a forecasted price at theharvest date which can be used for sowing decisions or storage decisions. 2 Free trade (within India 3 and across the border 4) generates arbitrage,where cheap goods are taken away and additional supply brought in when prices are high.<br>

<br>Page 72
four forces of stabilization—warehousing,futures trading, domestic trade and international trade<br>

<br>Page 73
The best functioning economy is one in which changes in supply and demand rapidly result in a change inthe price<br>

<br>Page 73
Supply and demand make the price. When prices go up, demand goes down. When prices go up, supply goes up. Free men and women will buy things where they are cheap and sell them where they are expensive, and thus arbitrage away pricing discrepancies. When there are large changes in a price in a short time, this can be disconcerting and impose problems upon some people. But if the government forces the price to change slowly, this makes things worse.<br>

<br>Page 74
Prices are the mechanism through which the market economy adjusts to shocks; by hindering price movement we postpone adjustment. In India, the legislature, the executive and the judiciary have all repeatedly undertaken actions which go against the grain of the price system. These actions are doomed to failure. When the policymaker tries to control the price, this is harmful, and the greatest harm is done when the policymaker tries to control both the price and the quantity. The policymaker should have no opinion on prices and not try to control prices. Policymakers must strengthen their intuition into the working of the price system, and go with the grain. The field of public policy is about identifying and addressing market failure, not controlling prices.<br>

inputs for healthy firms, and reduces the profitability of healthy firms. When a policy framework encourages the lingering survival of failed firms, this harms healthy firms in that sector.<br>

<br>Page 78
This is one reason why public sector companies are a problem for the economy: there is a greater risk of them becoming zombie firms backed by the exchequer. This is bad for public finance and bad for the economy.<br>

downturn. Consider a future date when the bankruptcy process works well. Under such conditions, when a business cycle downturn commences, weak firms will go into the bankruptcy process and get rapidly processed, their swift exit will improve profit margins of the survivors, and the resource reallocation will generate GDP growth. The<br>

<br>Page 80
faster that this process can play out, the shorter the downturn will be. A sound bankruptcy process gives less severe business cycle downturns<br>

The government as a source of market power<br>

<br>Page 81
Market power results in bad outcomes, regardless of whether the actor in question is public or private. We should be as zealous about dismantling state-induced barriers to competition as we are when attacking market power created by private persons.<br>

<br>Page 81
The desire for vigorous creative destruction animates our interest in competition policy. All across the economy, we require a progressive outlook supporting entry and competition. Political economy generally favours the incumbent, and leads us towards stagnation where one industry after another are locked up by a few powerful incumbents. At present, Indian public policy does not give pride of place to competition policy. Far from always promoting competition, many state actions at present hamper competition. Policymakers must constantly use the power of the state to prise open closed systems, to create conditions of extreme competition, and to see the bright side of firm failure. The prolonged survival of a weak firm, based on<br>

<br>Page 82
artificial life support, induces negative externalities upon healthy firms. The exit of these ‘zombie firms’ is a positive for the economy. It is likely that business cycle downturns will be shorter, once the bankruptcy process is fully in place. The Indian economy features the coexistence of high-productivity firms that abide by laws with low-productivity firms that violate laws. When law enforcement improves, and weak firms exit, GDP growth will be obtained through reallocation of labour and capital. Creative destruction is not alien to India: for small firms, it is the everyday reality. It is only with the large firms, and the areas connected with government, where competitive dynamics is poor.<br>

<br>Page 83
the effects of a given policy change may not show up in a concentrated fashion. But if small changes are spread over a large number of economic agents all over the economy, they may add up to a substantial impact (whether benign or malign) even if they are not sharply visible at any one place.<br>

<br>Page 84
By default, we are wired to look more narrowly. For reasons of functional specialization, the lines of turf, and the limitations of our minds, it is easier to look at one firm or one sector at a time. This is ‘partial equilibrium’ thinking. But every policy thinker must maintain a general equilibrium perspective in the back of her head.<br>

<br>Page 85
There is a relationship between the short run vs the long run, and partial equilibrium vs general equilibrium<br>

<br>Page 86
We normally see a few firms or an industry at a time. But actually, all parts of the economy are connected together in ‘general equilibrium’. Every change in one firm or one market induces ripples in every other market. The full general equilibrium effects play out slowly. In areas like tax policy, globalization, agriculture, or universal basic income, general equilibrium thinking has a lot to offer in understanding the policy issues.<br>

Difficulties with paternalism<br>

<br>Page 93
In addition, public choice theory encourages us to be sceptical when a politician or an official engages in paternalism. In addition to the lack of<br>

<br>Page 94
empathy (i.e., the policymaker is unable to step into the shoes of a poor person, and see the world from her eyes), there may also be self-interest at work.<br>

Distortions in the market economy<br>

<br>Page 95
The cleanest way to do redistribution is to pay out cash. We should let the price system do its job of effectively allocating resources, so as to obtain high GDP growth. The market economy would grow the pie, the government would tax a slice of the pie, and use this money for redistribution.<br>

Policy thinkers were attracted by three key features of workfare programmes. They are self-targeting: Only the poorest would utilize them. They are self-adjusting: When there are remunerative activities, e.g., associated with an agricultural cycle, there would be an automatic reduction in workfare. Finally, they are self-liquidating: Once incomes in a certain region go up, through economic growth, nobody would want to do manual labour at Rs 100/day. Over the years, these programmes would tend to fade away on their own.<br>

<br>Page 97
Successful redistribution makes great demands upon the capabilities of the policy process.<br>

<br>Page 98
It is hard for the state to be paternalistic as it does not know enough about individuals. Each person is different, and only the individual can choose what is best for herself. When the government tries to be paternalistic, value judgements are made by policymakers which are not amenable to rational discourse. No country solved poverty through redistribution. The first priority of policymakers should be to establish a vibrant market economy, through which the size of the pie grows strongly. After this, taxation can be used to obtain budgetary resources which are then redistributed. Distortions of the market economy, induced in the pursuit of redistribution, hinder GDP growth. That is tantamount to killing the golden goose. Subsidies distort behaviour of recipients. The marginal cost of public funds in India is high. The cost imposed upon the economy for Re 1 of public expenditure is about Rs 3. This implies that subsidy programmes induce a large adverse impact upon the GDP. It is easy to build state capacity for paying out subsidies such as the NREGS; it is hard to build state capacity for public goods such as the police. Competing political parties tend to enlarge subsidy expenditures as a way to win elections. The establishment of large subsidy programmes and the sense of entitlement that tends to arise around them create fiscal risk. Fighting poverty should be the clear objective of one or two anti-poverty programmes. The objective of the remainder of government should be to address market failure, without bringing distributional considerations into the picture.<br>

<br>Page 99
Ronald Coase brought fresh insight into this field, with what iscalled the ‘transaction costs perspective<br>

<br>Page 101
Before Ronald Coase, economists viewed negative externalities as a story with a perpetrator and a victim.<br>

<br>Page 101
As long as property rights are clear, both sides will be brought to the table to negotiate<br>

<br>Page 102
The Coasean approach requires the state to play a role in clearly defining property rights<br>

<br>Page 103
Traditional community solutions to the tragedy of the commons<br>

<br>Page 105
We should have greater respect for self-organizing systems that do not require state capacity.<br>

<br>Page 105
The first cut of public economics asks us to find market failures and address them. Sophisticated public economics whittles down the role for the state when compared with the first cut. When property rights and contract enforcement work well, private persons will negotiate their way to many good solutions. And even in the extreme, where large numbers of people are involved, some traditional community solutions achieve optimality. When feasible, these pathways are superior to the traditional toolkit of state intervention, as they involve less coercion. The conventional Indian discourse slips into moralizing, into a populist approach that favours the interests of the fishermen over the steel mill. This does not yield the optimal answer.<br>

<br>Page 113
Going beyond the qualitative recognition of a market failure, it is important to quantify the benefit that would be obtained for society by addressing the market failure. If the cost–benefit analysis shows that the costs imposed upon society, by the best solution, outweigh the prospective benefits, the cure is worse than the disease. The formal process of cost–benefit analysis helps avoid emotion, respects the interests of persons who have not mobilized to campaign or lobby for their own interests, helps bring long term considerations into the picture, and combats the sunk cost fallacy. Every new policy initiative should be launched with a clear statement of the problem that it seeks to solve, the demonstration that there is a market failure, and the cost–benefit analysis that was used to discover the best intervention. After a few years, it is useful to engage in ex post review, and change course if the original objectives were not met. Cost–benefit analysis is not a science, and there is a significant imprecision in all such estimates. We always see things more clearly in hindsight. The idea of ex post review is not to pillory the people who looked at the information at a certain<br>

<br>Page 114
point in time, e.g., in a moment of crisis, and made a decision. It is to establish feedback loops through which a process of iterative refinement sets in. Cost–benefit analysis is required for government intervention into society. It is not essential when doing internal reorganization of government organizations. The laws that give power to government agencies to intervene in society must codify the processes of cost–benefit analysis and ex post review. Through this, it induces an institutionalized application of mind, and improves the quality of work.<br>

<br>Page 116
Faced with a choice of a GDP of Rs 100 and a tax/GDP ratio of 20 per cent, vs a GDP of Rs 200 and a tax/GDP ratio of 15 per cent, we should prefer the latter. A single-minded focus upon the tax/GDP ratio is inappropriate; we must see the larger picture<br>

<br>Page 117
The legitimate concern about the import of capital lies in ensuring that there is a high degree of diversification. Capital should be coming into the country from a heterogeneous class of players, through many different financial channels, into many different kinds of domestic assets. This diversification will generate sustainable financing of the current account deficit. Once this is achieved, there is no difficulty associated with investment that is larger than savings<br>

<br>Page 118
‘the assignment principle’, which comes from the great economist Jan Tinbergen.<br>

<br>Page 119
Why do organizations find themselves in situations with more objectives than instruments<br>

<br>Page 120
Public choice theory predicts that public organizations will favour multiple objectives as this gives reduced accountability. Clarity of purpose is efficient for the principal and not the agent. It is our job, as policy thinkers, to hold the metaphoric feet of every agency to the fire, and hold it accountable for a narrow set of goals associated with a narrow set of powers. This requires drafting modern laws that clearly articulate objectives and establish commensurate accountability mechanisms.<br>

<br>Page 120
Formal process helps<br>

<br>Page 120
Formal documentation is required, before every move in public policy, which conducts such analysis. Without such formal statements, we run the risk of degenerating into shifting goalposts: An objective is stated, it fails to work out, the authorities then claim that the true objective was a different one.<br>

<br>Page 120
The first stumbling block in the policy process is posing the right question. When a policymaker wants large resources in order to run subsidy programmes, the right objective to pursue is tax revenue and not the<br>

<br>Page 121
tax/GDP ratio. The field of economic policy is littered with analytical fallacies that have set off entire policy communities in the wrong direction. Jan Tinbergen’s ‘assignment principle’ teaches us that one policy instrument can only be used for one objective. Monetary policy has only one instrument—the short-term interest rate—and can hence deliver only one objective, e.g., the targeted inflation rate. A great deal of policy confusion in India stems from placing multiple objectives upon policy initiatives. Public choice theory predicts that officials will favour multiple objectives so as to avoid accountability. A publicly stated and clear objective, on each policy initiative, improves the policy process.<br>

<br>Page 123
The heterogeneity of economic and social development, across the regions of India, generates heterogeneity in the public policy pathways desired by different groups of people<br>

<br>Page 123
The first involves reducing the extent to which decisions are taken in the Union government.<br>

<br>Page 124
The second involves creating structures that favour migration.<br>

<br>Page 124
The third involves fiscal transfers through which the per capita resources available to the state government in poor states are higher than the per capita taxation that is done in those states<br>

<br>Page 124
The subsidiarity principle asserts that a function should be placed at the lowest level of government where it can possibly be performed<br>

<br>Page 127
State-level politicians, who preach the cause of greater autonomy from the Union government, need to consistently carry this through and devolve full powers to the city governments within their states.<br>

<br>Page 128
The five pillars of checks and balances—data, intellectuals, media, legislature, judiciary—all work poorly upon state governments.<br>

<br>Page 128
The first issue is about problems that require coordination between states<br>

<br>Page 128
The second issue is about the possibility of severe capacity constraints in a state or a city<br>

<br>Page 129
India is a continent, with very high heterogeneity. There is no one answer to policy questions, on most problems. The fact that many Union Territoriesrun by the Union government—work better than many states should not lead us to question decentralization. Decentralization of government helps produce local answers to local problems. The ‘subsidiarity principle’ asserts that a function of government is best performed by the lowest possible level of government where it can be performed. The Constitution of India is imbued with federalism. The evolution of the republic shows an inappropriate extent of centralization, of schemes that are designed by the Union government and rolled out everywhere. The phrase ‘Union government’ is preferable to ‘Central government’ as the latter suggests greater control. Similarly, there is an inappropriate level of control of cities and villages by the capital of the state government. The appropriate role of the Union government lies in coordination problems (e.g., the design of infrastructure networks that cut across states) and in addressing poverty traps where the conventional feedback loops of liberal democracy have broken down. In a truly federal structure, state and local governments will have to design their own schemes. This requires capacity building in public policy at states and cities all over India. For decentralization to work, the political system at the level of the state and the city requires reform, in order to achieve adequate checks and balances and dispersion of power.<br>

<br>Page 132
In public policy, we should not undertake actions that will disrupt the lives of the people on a large scale<br>

<br>Page 133
This pursuit of non-intrusiveness, stability and order has one powerful implication: We should favour small impacts upon the lives of the people over large ones. Social engineering, even if for ostensibly noble goals, should not be attempted<br>

<br>Page 134
We know too little in order to safely meddle into human society in most areas other than market failures.<br>

<br>Page 134
This pursuit of non-intrusiveness, stability and order has a second implication: a bias in favour of communication.<br>

<br>Page 135
As a thumb rule, each doubling of GDP (in real terms) calls for a fairly far-reaching change in the organization structure of government.<br>

<br>Page 135
We should pursue revolutionary change for governmentstructures, but evolutionary change for the people.<br>

<br>Page 137
A good society is one in which individuals plan and live on their own terms, in a state of confidence over long time horizons. The purpose of public policy is to create the enabling conditions for such a life. As an example, the right way to structure monetary policy is a formal inflation-targeting system, as it rules out inflation surprises, and makes personal financial planning possible over multi-decade horizons. The best framework of public policy is one in which the state impinges upon the lives of individuals as little as possible. This is not a defence of the status quo. Society can and should evolve, gradually, through the thoughts and actions of the people. The state should not engage in social engineering, i.e., it should take no leadership role in the evolution of society. Non-intrusiveness, stability and order is fostered by better communication. The government must say what it will do and then do what it just said. There should be no surprises.<br>

<br>Page 137
Within the structures of government, however, it is permissible to undertake large-scale reorganizations. We do not need to bring stability to the life of a civil servant.<br>

Element 3: Small moves coupled with feedback loops<br>

The word ShiDian is used in China for ‘Policy Experimentation’ or ‘Policy Piloting’.<br>

<br>Page 142
Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and others have emphasized the importance of ‘randomized control trials’ in learning about economics. We see this as being a key part of the economic policy toolkit, in the process of iterative refinement.<br>

<br>Page 143
Irreversibility is thus inherent to some things (e.g., death of a person), is greater when measurement is lacking, and is greater when the action involves establishing an implementation structure in government. These are the areas where greater caution is required in state intervention.<br>

<br>Page 143
There are no silver bullets. The reforms that matter are complex multi-year journeys that require a large policy community. Participatory policymaking works better than small groups working in secret. The ideal mechanism is to have measurement systems, and make small moves. Based on the feedback from the measurement, the small moves can be refined and modified as part of a larger strategy. Do things that you can undo. Beware of the things that you cannot undo. When the measurement is weak, mistakes will not be caught, and there is a need for greater caution. Stroke-of-the-pen reforms are easier to reverse, but when a government organization has been set up, it is hard to undo, and there is a need for greater caution.<br>

<br>Page 144
Many a mistake will not be undone, so there is wisdom in intervening less.<br>

Envisioning policy choices in the Indian context<br>

<br>Page 149
Envisioning how a given policy initiative will work in India requires deep knowledge of the local context. We need to visualize all the moving parts and think about how one proposed piece will fit into the larger context. This requires knowledge of history, institutions and politics.<br>

<br>Page 150
The international experience is a valuable source of knowledge about higher design principles. Concepts like freedom, the public discourse, human rights, the rule of law, dispersion of power, negotiation, scientific inquiry, etc., are all drawn from enlightenment values. These are universal principles. It is when we come down to practical problems (e.g., how to organize the agricultural spot market) that the portability of ideas across countries breaks down.<br>

<br>Page 151
Sound policy analysis in India requires authenticity. It calls for deep experiential local knowledge (metis). The most valuable people in the Indian policy story are those who have authentic knowledge of India, and are able to imagine and envision how policy choices will play out in the Indian setting<br>

<br>Page 152
We would be fully able to debate with policy thinkers elsewhere in the world, and present Indian solutions as optimal pathways under Indian conditions, while carefully warning other countries that they have to think for themselves.<br>

<br>Page 152
Free-riding on state capacity outside India<br>

<br>Page 153
In the field of drugs and food, the US and EU authorities run active inspection programmes through which certain factories in India obtain the rights to produce drugs or food products which can be exported to the EU or the US. There is a natural opportunity for public policy in India to freeride on this work<br>

<br>Page 154
In the field of finance, we have had an interesting dichotomy between firms listed purely in India vs firms that are also listed in the US.<br>

<br>Page 155
Many policy notes in India are written by reviewing what is done in a few other countries, and patching together some plausible-sounding policy proposal for India. This approach works poorly. Enlightenment values port across the world, but tangible policy designs do not. We must go from a ‘thin description’ of what is done elsewhere in the world to a ‘thick description’, an incentive-based understanding of whyofficials and private persons behave as they do in advanced countries. 3A great deal of what happens in advanced economies relies on an ‘invisible infrastructure’ of state apparatus and checks and balances that is not immediately within view when focusing on a narrow problem of policy. The US SEC does certain things right because the United States Constitution establishes certain protections, but when we focus on how the US SEC works, these foundations tend to be overlooked. To do public policy in the Indian context requires envisioning how a proposed design of an intervention or a government organization will work in the Indian setting, with a deep understanding of the surrounding conditions. We only change one piece of policy at a time, while everything else stays unchanged. We have to find the best given the constraints of the environment. Ground-up design of solutions, from first principles, for the Indian environment will often look different from those seen elsewhere.<br>

<br>Page 156
The institutions of the First World carry enormous prestige. The sum total of these institutional designs adds up to modernity and prosperity. However, when one element at a time is sought to be transplanted into India, we run the risk of being the sorcerer’s apprentice (who uses the spell without knowing why it works) and engaging in isomorphic mimicry (copying the form without copying the function). Public policy thinking in India requires metis: deep experiential local knowledge. Level-1 thinking is coming up with nutty proposals. Level-2 thinking is copying from websites. Level-3 thinking is grounded in metis, in thinking from the first principles. There are some situations where it is possible for policy thinking in India to free-ride on state capacity outside India. When this can be done, this is welcome, as it reduces the requirements of building state capacity in India.<br>

Public policy work is a test match, not an IPL.<br>

<br>Page 158
Lags of policy impactThe most important reforms impose pain that is concentrated upon a few people, and gains that are diffused over the entire country. The pain comes early and the gains come with a lag. The political puzzle of reforms lies in managing these two tensions. The art of politics lies in understanding the map of interests and pulling off such reforms. This involves understanding who will lose in the short run, negotiating with them and influencing their view of the world, modifying the reform in non-fundamental ways so as to reduce the pain upon these persons, and sometimes compensating them through other instruments. It involves harnessing the support of the gainers from the reform.Policymaking on the election clock<br>

Policymaking on the election clock<br>

<br>Page 159
The clock that counts the years to the next elections weighs heavily upon this thinking. The art of politics lies in thinking through these time horizons, launching a portfolio of reforms in year 1 and year 2, which induce pain (attenuated by specific transfers to affected parties) in year 2 and year 3, and yield overall gains by year 4 and year 5. This requires extreme capability in the team that wins power. The incoming team cannot just land up in power, take control of the levers of power, and wield power in random ways based on political compulsions and ideology. They need to have a portfolio of policy proposals, backed by teams of experts, with fully articulated planning of actions, anticipated impacts, design of the measurement system to monitor the process on an ongoing basis, identification of the persons negatively impacted, and possibly the design of compensatory transfers to defuse the unhappiness. There is a crucial role for the communication strategy that is put into play from the date the cabinet is formed. In this age of Twitter, ‘communication strategy’ consists of catchy slogans and choice abuse. The true role of communication, however, lies in improving coordination on an economy scale. The political and technocratic leadership must have a shared strategy and shared messaging, through which the full picture is consistently and strongly communicated. This would help align expectations and ensure that private persons change their strategies in ways that are coherent with the strategy of reforms. If there is no strategy in reforms, or if it is not properly communicated to the private sector, businesses and financial investors will make mistakes in the formulation of their strategies, which will result in reduced economic performance. This will increase the time lag between the policy change and its full beneficial impact.Example 24: Cutting the peak customs rate by 5 percentage points every year<br>

<br>Page 160
In 2000, the Vajpayee government chose a path : the peak customs rate would drop by 5 percentage points every year. Everyone in the administration understood the strategy and consistently communicated it. At first, there was an uproar from incumbent firms, and the government had to deal with their anger in year 1. From year 2 onward, firms understood that the peak rate was going to be down by an additional 20 percentage points by year 5. This set off India’s firms on paths of fundamental productivity growth, and improved the choice of investment projects. Every step of the way, as customs duties were cut, tradeables in India became cheaper, and this kicked off an export boom. This combination of communication and staggered introduction of the reform induced synchronization between the government and the private sector. This was critical for the economic boom which started in 2003.Before the first yearIn the world of business, there is a balance between building a great product and selling it on the market. An extreme emphasis on a sales and advertising team can yield a brief surge of customer interest, but this does not translate into sustained success if the product is not of high quality and the machinery of production and distribution is not in place. In other words, a firm needs not just sales and advertising, it also needs research, design and operations management. It needs a great product and the capability to produce and distribute the product, on top of which the sales and advertising offensive is essential. There is an analogy with the world of politics. Running an election campaign is analogous to the sales and advertising problem. To win power, this is essential. But if this is all that is done, sustained voter satisfaction will be elusive. Political parties need to prepare to govern, alongside campaigning to get elected. Once the election results are in, every day lost in establishing the team and kicking off a portfolio of reforms is a costly delay. We are doing too little transition planning in Indian politics.<br>

<br>Page 161
When out of power, political parties should have a shadow cabinet. There should be a sustained process of engagement with think tanks, academic institutions, data sets and intellectuals, in order to cogitate about what is going wrong. The emphasis in an opposition party should be not just on criticizing what the ruling party has done, but on developing a set of plans for what would be done when in power. The incumbent ruling party equally faces this problem. At year 5, a successful ruling team is jaded, and an unsuccessful ruling team is demoralized. Yet, it needs to think through the possibility of re-election, and find the energy for transition planning. This preparatory work would be particularly valuable when it is fed into the manifesto of the political party and, when coalition governments are formed, the negotiation for a common minimum programme. The paragraphs in such documents matter disproportionately, but receive inadequate attention ahead of time. Long-range thinking and capacity building are required in each political party to develop the capability to succeed in the event of winning elections. When such developmental work is not done, ahead of time, we translate remarkable election outcomes into failures on policy.Playing the long gameA cult of jald baazi is taking root in India. This is the notion that a problem can be understood in a few days, and solved in a few weeks. Powerful policymakers tend to whip up a frenzy of getting things done quickly. Every expert in India has gone through the surreal experience of being ignored for years, and then asked to deliver a reform document overnight.You rush a miracle man, you get a rotten miracle. The Princess Bride, 1987 film<br>

<br>Page 162
This is a harmful approach. In some rare situations, a team is available in India, which is fully imbued with a problem, has the right understanding, has the right human networks in the country, has learned how to work with each other, and can move at high speed in executing a reform. Even under these conditions, drafting laws and building state capacity takes a long time. In most situations, there is a starvation of intellectual capacity in the country. We lack data, knowledge, experts and teams that know how to work with each other. There is thus a slow process of understanding problems, designing solutions, going up from individuals to teams with esprit de corps, and implementing reforms. The cult of speed yields failure in both cases. Even when the best teams are assembled, if the work which requires two years is compressed into a few months, this will be done badly. With weak teams, the pressure of solving a problem in a few months surely yields failure. There is a pipeline in the policy reform process: data to research to policy proposals to consensus to government decisions to policy implementation. It is not possible to short-circuit this process. Some fields are at a weaker stage, where the basics of data and research are not in place. In these fields, the only horizons over which meaningful policy reform can be achieved are a long time horizon. The cult of speed is ultimately derived from management failure in government. We are faring poorly on establishing institutions which contain harmonious teams that impound information and expertise; we are unable to make long-term plans and stay focused on them. We suffer from a strong pace of personnel changes, which prevent the development of knowledge and rapport within policy teams. We suffer from three-page notes of individual reform measures, typically written by interested parties, which lack strategic thinking. We fluctuate from one topic to another, based on the crises that engulf us each day. When a government flits from one issue to the next based on the news cycle, there is no strategy. It would behove the policy process to be sceptical about the solutions that are hawked in three-page notes, to be slow and cautious. We should set a<br>

high bar on the minimum level of knowledge and evidence required before embarking upon even a modest intervention into the lives of private people.Example 25: The bankruptcy reformParliament enacted the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in May 2016. There was a great rush in quickly getting the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India up and running, and in declaring the IBC open for business. Many corners were cut in getting to a quick launch. By early 2019, we have seen many difficulties in the working of the IBC. The big cases have proved stubbornly hard to process. Consider an alternative history. Would it have made sense to lay the groundwork from May 2016 to May 2018, and only then declare the IBC open for business? We suspect that things would have looked better by early 2019, if that slow path had been taken.Example 26: The Rhine was not cleaned in a dayIn 1986, a blast at the Sandoz chemical plant in Basel, Switzerland, leaked tonnes of toxic chemicals in the Rhine, Europe’s longest river. The 1233km-long transboundary river, passes through Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, Germany, France and Holland. This presented complex multination problems of policy coordination, in order to clean the river. In 1987, the Rhine Action Plan was drawn up, with a simple and bold target: By the year 2000, there would be salmon in the Rhine again. The implementation plan employed a variety of measures and instruments to clean the river—from expanding and equipping biological sewage treatment plants, to working with non-profits like Greenpeace to monitor emissions levels, and industrial regulation and enforcement. While the original plan had a bold target of an outcome in thirteen years, in reality, it took thirty years and 45 billion Euros, and the fish were back.<br>

<br>Page 164
After this, the Rhine Action Plan was reformulated as the more ambitious goal, over a ten-year horizon, that the riverine ecosystem would become athriving environment for all creatures. 1Building a bridge vs building institutionsPolicymakers in India now understand how to build a bridge. They know that building a bridge is expensive, that it requires professionals to build, that there will be a project plan, that many steps have to be undertaken, and these take time, and only then can a bridge be inaugurated. The same approach is required with state capacity! When a new government organization is required: (a) It will be expensive; (b) It requires professionals to build it; (c) There must be a formal project plan in order to build the organization and its capabilities; and (d) Implementing this project plan will take time. Only when the project is completed, can a new organization be declared open for business. We have repeatedly seen new organizations being launched in the Indian state in a casual and informal way. The present ways—of hiring a few people and declaring a government agency open for business within a very short time horizon—are downright harmful. Right at the outset, the organization is crushed with demands that it is ill-prepared for. The fledgling organization is underfunded and under-resourced in every possible way. It gets into a firefighting mindset, makes mistakes, and generally never recovers from the early failures. We in India have learned how infrastructure projects require time and money. We need to carry this professional approach into building statecapacity in government organizations. 2The equity market reform started at the G.S. Patel Committee report in 1984. A humble researcher in this team, R.H. Patil, was central to the establishment of NSE. SEBI was begun as a non-statutory organization in 1988. The pieces of the equity market fell into place by 2001. There was an exciting journey of ideas and action, with the establishment of SEBI, NSE<br>

<br>Page 165
and NSDL, which ran from 1984 to 2001. This gave fundamental progress in the equity market. We may have thought that once completed, this would stand in place. In the event, there was a dissipation of the institutional memory. The experiences of the 1980s and 1990s, which shaped decisions of the 1990s, were forgotten. In numerous aspects, there has been a retreat in the capabilities of the financial markets in the recent decade. As an example, the first settlement failure in the history of the NSE, and the first settlement failure in the Indian equity market after a gap of nineteen years, took placein 2019. 3Similarly, the pension reforms began with Project OASIS, led by Surendra Dave, in 1998. This led up to the decision in December 2002 to implement the New Pension System (NPS) for new recruits into the government. Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) was set up, and the law enshrining PFRDA was only enacted in 2013. However, there was a dissipation of the institutional memory. The experiences of the 1990s, and the logic of the NPS, were forgotten in many important ways. These experiences underline the importance of building stable teams which are able to engage with the reforms process over long time horizons. Each area of work is a complex problem with many moving parts. As policy projects unfold over long time horizons, we require teams and policy continuity over long time horizons. When staffing is unstable, and when institutional memory is lost, we lose ground.Building the republic takes timeIt took hundreds of years to build the US, the UK and the other mature liberal democracies of the world. As an example, the US Constitution was written in 1776, but the ‘fruit of the poisonous tree’ doctrine—which is absolutely fundamental to limiting the power of investigative agenciesonly came together in the early twentieth century, i.e., 154 years after the<br>

founding of the country. It was only in the 1970s that US lawmakers shut off domestic operations by the CIA, and brought electronic surveillance by investigative agencies under the rule of law. Similarly, it took seventy years from 1947 for India to decriminalize gay sex. Assuming there is progress towards freedom and the rule of law in the future, it will prove to take over seventy years to get to basic elements of civil liberties including decriminalization of defamation, removal of sedition from the IPC, and placing electronic surveillance of the populace under a rule of law framework. These are long and slow journeys. We should not look for the newspaper headlines, the quick wins, the buzz on social media. We should instead dig into the long and slow process of genuinely building the republic.Summing upWhen a policy reform takes place, the full gains are obtained through the reallocation of resources in the economy. Policy reform requires private persons to fully internalize the new environment, and re-optimize for it. Many policy reforms require the construction of institutional capacity within government and in the economy. These adjustments take time. For this reason, the pain is front-loaded and the gains come with a lag. Policymakers need to understand who will lose in the short run, negotiate with them, and find compromises with them. After elections take place, and the leadership faces a five-year horizon, it is useful to think of year 1 as the time to launch complex initiatives, which will mature through years 2, 3 and 4, and show positive impacts by year 5. This imposes demands on the team formed after the elections. It needs to choose the major projects, staff them, and communicate this to the economy so as to reshape expectations. This requires considerable work within political parties before winning the election. Such thinking over long time horizons diverges from the cult of speed that is often found in Indian public policy, where three-page notes are<br>

<br>Page 167
written over a weekend and implemented over the week. Such actions tend to be superficial and achieve little. There is a pipeline of the policy process, from measurement all the way to policy execution. The institutional memory of each field is contained in a community of intellectuals and policy practitioners. The pipeline and the community need to be nurtured, in order to play the long battles of policy reform. We in India now know that a bridge across a river is a project that has to go through certain steps. It takes time, money and professional capacity in order to build a bridge. We have to see policy reforms in a similar way. There is no short cut from the date on which it is decided that a bridge shall be built, to the date on which the bridge is inaugurated. Building the republic takes time. It will take many decades of hard work by the policy community for India to rise to the ranks of the advanced nations of the world. Policy reform is slow, hard work, and not amenable to quick wins on social media.<br>

20What is hard and what is easyWhen we think of a given government intervention, we need to judge how hard it would be for successful implementation. Suppose the Indian state is evaluating a universal human papillomavirus (HPV) immunization programme for children. While we know that this is hard, it is in the zone of feasible policy pathways. But suppose the Indian state is evaluating a programme where officials will interview unemployed individuals and decide which of them should get welfare payments every month. This seems beyond the reach of the implementation capacity of the Indian state. What are the general principles through which we can engage in such reasoning?Four dimensions of complexityLant Pritchett and Michael Woolcock first posed this question and offeredelements of the answer. 1 They predict that implementation is hard whenthere is more discretion and when there are a larger number of transactions. In addition, implementation is harder when there is more at stake for private persons, and when there is more secrecy. Number of transactions: It is easier to achieve state capacity on a problem where there are a smaller number of transactions. A vast sprawling machinery involves greater agency problems; it is difficult to be sure that every element of the administrative machine is working correctly. Discretion: It is easier to achieve state capacity when there is low discretion. An immunization programme is a good example, where there is<br>

a population-scale outreach, but the work that has to be done by each civil servant is fixed and there is no discretion. Stakes: It is harder to achieve state capacity when there is more at stake for private persons. Problems like the criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and financial regulation are the hardest puzzles. Here, the decisions of state agents have enormous consequences for individuals, and private persons will devote considerable effort in trying to influence the outcome. Secrecy: The bulk of the working of the Ministry of Rural Development takes place in the open. Policy documents and data sets come out into the public domain. This makes the feedback loops of analysis and criticism more effective. In contrast, the secrecy that surrounds a ministry, such as the Ministry of Defence, can serve as a cloak for poor performance.Example 27: Monetary policy is easy, financial regulation is hardBy this reasoning, monetary policy is a relatively easy problem:Low discretion: Once inflation targeting is embedded in the law, there is a clear accountability mechanism. Individuals who make the decision have relatively limited discretion. Individuals who make flagrantly wrong decisions will be exposed in public and will suffer lifetime reputational damage. Low number of transactions: There is no citizen-facing part to monetary policy. It is only four to six decisions a year. Low stakes: Raising or lowering the policy rate has important consequences for the economy as a whole but it is of extreme importance, at a personal level, to nobody. Not much is at stake as far as private persons are concerned; there will be relatively little tangible lobbying or pressure in trying to influence the outcome. It is interesting to see that when the monetary policy transmission is weak, the stakes are even lower, as small changes in the policy rate have a negligible impact upon the economy. It is easier to establish<br>

independence of the central bank under conditions of a weak monetary policy transmission. Low secrecy: A sound central bank has essentially zero secrecy, so there is the full potency of analysis and criticism in the public domain, thus giving strong feedback loops from failure to improvement.Hence, monetary policy is a relatively easy puzzle in state capacity building. A small elite is required that writes the rules of the game, that gets the country up to a modern central banking law. A small elite is required which mans the monetary policy committee. Central banks can be fairly small, lean organizations. The complexity of solving principal–agent problems in a large organization can be avoided. In contrast, financial regulation is a difficult problem. A lot of behaviour lies in the shades of grey; there is discretion for the investigator and the prosecutor in classifying a certain activity as a violation or not. There are a large number of transactions; there are thousands of financial firms and there is a requirement for perhaps a thousand investigators and prosecutors in India. The stakes are sky high. How regulations are drafted and enforced makes a difference of trillions of rupees in terms of the payoffs to private persons. Billionaires have a great incentive to reshape the working of financial regulation in their favour, and they will use every trick in the book in trying to impact on the policy process. There is a good deal of secrecy. Supervision, investigations, enforcement and the quasi-judicial process of financial regulators is cloaked in a good deal of secrecy. Hence, financial regulation is a difficult problem in constructing statecapacity. 2Solutions that reduce complexity in some dimensions<br>

There is a great deal of optimism about the extent to which modern IT solves problems of governance. We are able to see one zone where IT systems are truly transformational: in the removal of discretion. As an example, when there is an IT system through which railway tickets are sold, the discretion of the front line sales person is eliminated. IT systems ease the construction of state capacity by offering processengineering through which discretion can be removed. 3 This is a recurringtheme running across many great opportunities for utilising IT in buildingstate capacity. 4Example 28: Judicial reformsIn the working of courts and tribunals, there are two distinct elements which can be seen as pillars of intervention. There is the highly discretionintensive problem of the thinking of the judge. Alongside this, there is the low-discretion and transaction-intensive problem of running the operational processes of the court. This is also termed ‘the registry’ of the court. It is possible to bring modern business process re-engineering into the working of the operational procedures. This approach is likely to give substantial gains in the operational efficiency of courts, while leaving theindependence of the judiciary intact. 5This is a useful vertical split, between high-discretion and low-discretion parts of the working of a court. Using modern IT systems, the lowdiscretion part can be rapidly transformed.Solutions that change from one dimension of complexity to anotherMany government offices in India find it difficult to achieve clean toilets. Cleaning the toilets is a transaction-intensive problem, which calls for<br>

<br>Page 171
Solutions that change from one dimension of complexity to another<br>

<br>Page 172
considerable state capacity in being able to recruit and manage a cleaning crew. This is a well-defined service function, which does not involve the use of coercive power upon the people, and hence it can be contracted out. Our first impulse might thus be: Why not replace tenured janitors who do not clean the toilets by a private contractor who will not give tenure to her employees? This appears to offer gains in one dimension: We are replacing a transaction-intensive function (janitors cleaning) by a small number of transactions (procuring and monitoring the private contractor). In the process, however, we do run up to larger stakes. A tenured janitor gains about Rs 150,000 a year (her wage) from doing no work. In contrast, a private contractor that undertakes cleaning services for an entire building may be paid Rs 1.5 crore (Rs 15 million) a year. The private contractor now stands to gain a bigger amount by doing no work. The stakes are higher. It now requires a large amount of state capacity, albeit in a different dimension, to ensure the contract goes to the right person, using a fair process, and is adequately monitored. When PPP was first proposed as a way to improve upon low-quality infrastructure built by government departments, this was hailed as a big step forward. With the benefit of hindsight, we see that PPP contracting is hard, as the stakes are high.The four hardest problemsThe criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and financial regulation suffer from the problem of high discretion, high number of transactions, very high stakes and varying amounts of secrecy. How the front-line policeman behaves can make a difference of life and death for a person. This gives extreme discretionary power to the policeman. The hardest problems in state capacity are the criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and financial regulation.<br>

<br>Page 173
Learn to walk before you runOnce we see that high stakes harm the construction of state capacity, a natural tool for sequencing is to initially start at low stakes. If the fine for driving through a red light is Rs 10,000, there will be pervasive corruption. Jobs in the highway police will be sought after; large bribes will be paid to obtain these jobs. There will be an institutional collapse of the highway police. It is better to first start with a fine of Rs 100, and build state capacity. Once a country has learned how to run a highway police at a fine of Rs 100, we can think of going up to larger fines. A low tax rate induces low stakes. High tax rates are a high load upon the state, as the personal incentives of tax administrators (to take bribes) become highly divergent from the objectives of the institutions that they represent. Public anger about the failures of the criminal justice system in India has often given a sharp escalation of punishments. This leads to higher stakes, and thus reduces the capability of the criminal justice system. When we are at the early stages of learning how to be a state, it is wise to start out at low stakes (e.g., low tax rates, low punishments). Once capabilities are fully established, there can be a mature debate about whether the right policy pathways involve higher stakes (e.g., higher taxrates, higher punishments). 6Summing upWhen we face a problem in public policy, it is important to assess how difficult it will be, to build the requisite state capacity. Four factors shape this:1. Transaction intensity: If something involves a large number of transactions, by a large number of front-line civil servants, it is harder.<br>

<br>Discretion: If something involves more discretion in the hands of the civil servant, it is harder. 3. Stakes: If there are high stakes, it is harder. 4. Secrecy: When there is greater secrecy, it is harder.Monetary policy is easy while financial regulation is hard because the latter involves a larger number of transactions, a greater use of discretion, high stakes and greater secrecy. Complexity in this four-dimensional space is not immutable. We can often undertake actions that reduce the complexity in some of these dimensions or trade off complexity in one dimension for another dimension. The four hardest problems are the criminal justice system, the judiciary, the tax system and the financial regulation. They suffer from high transactions, high discretion, high stakes and high secrecy. If a government organization is asked to suddenly achieve capability on a difficult problem, it will collapse in an organizational rout. A natural way to sequence the construction of state capacity is to first start with an easier problem, to achieve success, and then escalate the complexity. At an early stage in the republic, it will help to reduce discretion, reduce secrecy and most importantly, reduce the stakes. At first, agencies should be given low powers to investigate and the punishments that can be awarded should be low. This will create better conditions for achieving state capacity.<br>

21Confident policymakers work in the openIn public policy, we don’t just dine with friends, we must also sup with fiends. Ashok DesaiThere is a long tradition of secrecy in public policy in India. Too often, in India, a reform is pushed through as a sudden fait accompli upon the losers. As the complexity of the economy has grown, and as Indian democracy has matured, it is increasingly unwise to maintain this level of secrecy.Secrecy harms planning and executionExposing early drafts to the persons who have a lot at stake may often yield improvements in the work. Particularly when we have low state capacity, the most well-meaning reform is often marred by technical mistakes in the execution. A more open policy process catches more errors and it improves the resulting work. As an example, most draft laws in India are faulty owing to gaps in capabilities for drafting law in government organizations and in their supporting law firms. A thorough and genuine process of consultation will find mistakes. One of the reasons why the demonetization decision suffered from difficulties of policy design and implementation was the secrecy in which it was surrounded. The areas of Indian public policy which are shrouded in secrecy (military, intelligence, trading in the RBI treasury) may have the biggest flaws.<br>

<br>Page 176
The full gains from a reform require a great deal of advance planning and preparation by myriad private persons. This developmental work takes place if there is ample advance warning. The same reform will deliver better results if the overall economy has been primed for the idea adequately.Losers from a reform require fair warningEvery reform hurts certain firms and certain persons. With more advance warning, they can plan their life better. This would reduce the costs for the economy as a whole. As an example, consider the simplest reform: trade liberalization. Certain Indian factories, in areas where India does not have a comparative advantage, have to close down when the trade liberalization is done. We as a country have two choices: to present them with a surprise big-bang trade liberalization, or to talk about it every step of the way and give ample warning. By giving ample warning, for many years, firms will cut back on investments in physical capital and organizational capital into the businesses that are not going to survive trade liberalization. This reduces the destruction of capital that always accompanies trade liberalization.The policy process is one of negotiationThere is a valuable political economy perspective upon this question, where we see all reforms as a process of negotiation. Healthy democracies are those where various interest groups are able to sit together, engage in discourse in good faith, and emerge with reasonable compromises. The essential foundation for the democratic process of negotiation is trust—a certain presumption of good faith. We as a society need to experience decades upon decades of decent behaviour with each other, in order to learn how to trust each other to<br>

<br>Page 176
Every reform hurts certain firms and certain persons. With more advance warning, they can plan their life better. This would reduce the costs for the economy as a whole<br>

<br>Page 176
The policy process is one of negotiation<br>

<br>Page 177
negotiate in good faith. This will yield a political system in which we are able to rise above partisan hatred and enter into bargains that make everyone better off. The trust building that is required for this is hampered when policy measures are hatched in secrecy and suddenly unveiled upon the populace. The persons who get hurt feel that they were not treated fairly. This adversely affects the trust capital of the country, and holds back our emergence as a mature political system.Give people time to change behaviourLet us go back to the example of trade liberalization. So far, we have emphasized the presence of people who lose from the reform. But sheer fairness requires that they need to be able to plan for this ahead of time. But the full impact upon the economy works through a series of adaptations. Some of the affected firms may choose to wind down their business or sell it. Others will choose to push up their productivity. Some firms that use goods that have lower tariffs will now see new opportunities to make things for the local or overseas market, as a consequence of lower prices. This may, in turn, kick off technological changes. The full impact of a policy measure plays out in reshaping the work of the private sector. It is better for this work to commence as early as possible. For this reason, an open and consultative process works better. If private persons have ample warning, their adaptations commence at an earlier date. Through this, the lags of the policy process are reduced. The gains for the economy are obtained in a shorter period. It is easy to deride ‘paralysis through analysis’. For many people who are not instinctively comfortable with intellectual discourse, the slow process of public debates and government committees seems like a waste of time. Reaching out to critics is tactically costly as this increases the say that critics have in stalling or subverting a reform. The authoritarian impulse, to favour action over talk, is fashionable.<br>

<br>Page 177
Give people time to change behaviour<br>

<br>Page 178
However, the best policy work gets done in the open. The participatory policy process, grounded in intellectual debate, generates a better reforms process. It helps avoid a policy process that is pure power play. The work is better rooted in the landscape of people and institutions. The mistakes are more likely to be taken out. The negotiations and compromises create support and legitimacy. Policy implementation works out better.Example 29: Petroleum reforms, the ‘R group’An example of this is the ‘R Group’ which worked on petroleum policy reform starting in 1995. This involved all parties to the thinking, worked in the open, negotiated short-term vs long-term elements of the reform, and laid the foundations of an important and successful reform. A group of young leaders from public sector oil companies—all below age thirty—was formed, to prepare a road map to international competitiveness. The idea was that these individuals had a long-term stake in the success of the reform, and would be less invested in the present ways. This was termed the ‘below thirty group’. The ‘R group’ was set up under the chairmanship of the secretary, Petroleum and Natural Gas (Vijay Kelkar). The members were the leaders of public sector and private sector firms, and independent experts. Multiple conferences took place with the leaders of trade unions on the benefits from the liberalization programme chosen by the ‘below thirty group’. The reforms began by replacing administered prices by international oil prices, for all upstream companies including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). This was coupled with competition in new exploration. ONGC simultaneously got better revenues and greater competition. ONGC also got the freedom to operate in the world, just like any large oil company would. The next step was open competition in the downstream industry, along with replacing the cost-plus pricing regime by international parity pricing.<br>

<br>Page 179
This was introduced sequentially. It began with industrial inputs such as naphtha and fuel oil, and then for transportation fuels such as petrol and diesel, and finally for the household fuels, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Finally, the price of natural gas was linked to international fuel oil prices, instead of a cost-plus pricing regime. This entire story took place over a six-year period. It led to increased investments in upstream, midstream and downstream sectors, productivity gains and higher accretion of domestic oil and gas reserves. There was no political friction in this process. As the reforms were extensively discussed, there were no unpleasant shocks either to consumers or to producers, and the gains for consumers and for trade unions outweighed the pain. The entry of private firms was done through carefully designed auction procedures, so as to avoid accusations of corruption.Example 30: Inflation targetingInflation targeting was talked about by some intellectuals in the early years of the first decade of the millennium, as a response to the difficulties that RBI was then facing with monetary policy. This public debate at an intellectual level led to the first recommendation in a government committee report by Percy Mistry, titled ‘Mumbai as an international financial centre’ (MIFC), in 2007. This was followed by a similar recommendation in Raghuram Rajan’s report in 2009. This was followed by a draft law for inflation targeting by Justice Srikrishna’s ‘Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission’. There was a great deal of debate in newspaper columns, blog articles, research papers and conference panels. This was followed by an RBI committee, headed by Urjit Patel, which also recommended that inflation targeting be adopted. The implementation was done in two steps: first, the ‘Monetary Policy Framework Agreement’ that was signed between the finance secretary, Rajiv Mehrishi, and the RBI governor, Raghuram Rajan,<br>

<br>Page 180
on 20 February 2015, and next, the amendment to the RBI Act in February 2016. This was not a small reform. This was the biggest milestone in RBI’s history. It is fitting that alongside the introduction of a 4 per cent consumer price index (CPI) target into the RBI Act, the text in the preamble to the RBI Act which established the RBI in 1934 as ‘a temporary measure’ was simultaneously deleted. This was a long and slow journey for the RBI—from a temporary measure in 1934 to the first intellectual clarity in the early years of the millennium to the modified RBI Act in 2016. Policymakers developed a strategy and gradually executed it, in a completely open process, to the point where, at the end, it was an inevitable non-event.From date of announcement to date effectiveFrom these points of view, it is particularly important to ensure there is a substantial lag between the date of a policy announcement and the date on which it becomes effective. One of the most harmful things that is taking place in the Indian state is announcements that show up on a website in the evening, without any previous notice, and are effective next morning. These impose huge costs upon private persons, and drive up the ex ante fear of policy risk in the minds of firms.Professional capabilities in public policyThere is a pattern in the Indian story, where weak policy teams tend to operate in a more secretive way. There seems to be a lack of confidence in being able to win arguments in the public domain. The weakest ideas are hatched in secrecy and suddenly sprung upon the economy.<br>

<br>Page 181
This is related to the problems of knowledge partnerships and the comfort with intellectual discourse. The best policy teams in India are well connected into intellectual capabilities, are comfortable with criticism, and are able to debate with their critics as part of the public discourse. Weak policy teams are more likely to be disconnected from intellectual capabilities, work in secrecy, react in a hostile way to criticism, and deliver poor results in policymaking. When a policy team is comfortable with articulating and debating a reform in public, and listens to other points of view in order to engage in a process of iterative refinement, this sends a signal to private persons that there is genuine capability in the policy process. This improves the legitimacy of the policy process and increases optimism that good work will be done.Summing upGood debate to good debate, knowledge grows. Ancient Sanskrit proverbSecrecy harms policy planning and execution. In a liberal democracy, the relationship between the policymaker and the individual is not the relationship between a ruler and a subject. The policy process is a process of negotiation. The losers from a reform require fair warning. When there is ample warning, the adaptations of the private sector kick in early, and the gains for the economy are obtained in a shorter time. Confident policymakers work in the open. Working in the open signals capability. The most harmful events are those where a policy announcement shows up on a website in the evening, without any prior warning, and is effective next morning. The best episodes are those with an open consultative process, where the legal instrument showing up on the website is a non-<br>

<br>Page 182
event, and there is ample lead time between the date of announcement and the date effective.<br>

22Criticism and conflict have great valueYour critic should live right next door.Sant TukaramOur traditional self-image of India consists of seeing us as a healthy liberal democracy. There are, however, many disturbing features which have crept in gradually. As an example, we may think that India has a free press, but India is now ranked 140th out of 180 countries on press freedom, by Reporters Without Borders. As a consequence, there is much less criticism of the establishment than is required. As policymakers, we tend to develop a point of view. We should, however, be humble. We are not omniscient, and we are frequently wrong. It is wise to listen to our critics as they are likely to often be right.Good for fairness, good for self-interestA healthy democracy is one in which diverse points of view are able to engage in civil discussions, engage in give-and-take, and search for common ground. Critics see the world from diverse points of view. All these points of view are legitimate elements of the democratic process of negotiation and compromise. In this point of view, acceptance of criticism is integral to norms of good behaviour in liberal democracy, and is a noble thing.<br>

<br>Page 184
Respecting and valuing criticism is not just about fair play. As the Marathi aphorism by Sant Tukaram at the beginning of the chapter says, it is also about the self-interest of the policymaker. As our information and wisdom are always limited, it is useful to have people in our midst, who will identify mistakes in our reasoning. Neuroscientists have described a phenomenon called ‘the power paradox’: persons who possess power appear to become more impulsive, less risk-aware, and less adept at seeing things from other people’s point ofview. 1 This makes mistakes more likely. Encouraging and respectingcriticism is the key path to avoiding hubris. Another dimension of the gains from nurturing criticism is related to the idea of crossing the river by feeling the stones, using feedback loops. The best way to make progress is to take small steps, and to listen to the statistical evidence. A distributed system of criticism can tap into a larger knowledge base, and create valuable feedback through which course corrections at intermediate stages can be achieved. The peculiar twist in India is that in many areas, the statistical system is weak. We are down to gathering anecdotal evidence by talking to people. No one individual can talk with a large number of people. Each critic is valuable insofar as she represents information from a different subset of the system under examination. Critics of public policy strategies are a valuable part of society, and essential for the process of crossing the river by feeling the stones. The critic is not a bad human being; the critic is not an enemy; he is someone who has given you free advice that helps strengthen your work.We must love them both, those whose opinions we share and those whose opinions we reject, for both have labored in the search for truth, and both have helped us in finding it.St. Thomas AquinasWe need not agree with our critics, but our critics can help us see the flaws in our thinking and make improvements. We should not attack critics, and we should not encourage sycophants. We should foster an intellectual landscape featuring honest analysis and discussion. When person X praises<br>

<br>Page 185
the policymaker and person Y criticizes the policymaker, it is more useful for the policymaker to meet person Y and understand the logic of the criticism. This conversation may result in course corrections. In an environment where critics are attacked and harmed, these feedback loops will be harmed. The government will then encourage sycophants, who will always praise the government. Mid-course corrections will not take place. Lacking in the support system of criticism, the government will stumble from one mistake to the next. Authoritarian regimes, that neglected the value of feedback, have repeatedly failed in the human experience of thousands of years.Conflict in the public domain is the healthy stateAuthoritarian regimes look well organized and powerful, like the clean formations in a military parade. There is a great leader, and everyone is deferential to the positions of the great leader and the inner circle of power. Once a position is taken, everyone falls in line, in public, with a great deal of flattery. The great leader is incapable of making mistakes and must always be praised. There are disagreements and conflicts, of course, but they take place outside the public gaze, and tend to degenerate into pure power play.No government can be long secure without a formidable opposition. Benjamin DisraeliThe absence of a true opposition has led to the rapid deterioration of democracy into a kind of totalitarianism.C. Rajagopalachari 2In contrast, democracies look messy. They are riven with debate, dissension, and a tug of war. Power is dispersed across many individuals and many elements of the government. Neutral and intellectual voices weigh in on the conflicts that are played out in the public domain.<br>

<br>Page 186
This policy process is a world of ideas and rational thinking, and not merely an exercise in power play. The continuous debate in an environment of dispersed power is the reason why democracies work well. The continuous process of criticism and debate finds and solves mistakes. In the best of times, most people are greatly influenced by voices around them. On most subjects, we do not have deep expertise, and tend to go with the mainstream. Conversely, if novel proposals are not vigorously contested, there is the danger of oddball ideas taking root. This problem is particularly seen in authoritarian countries. When the establishment takes a certain position, and there is a great deal of sycophantic applause, the climate of opinion shifts. This is also why authoritarian governments work badly. When we think about criticizing the government, it is important to see that government is not a monolithic creature. Government is made up of many individuals and agencies, all of which have different points of view. Criticism of the stated position of an agency generally strengthens the hand of the reformers within the agency. An environment where all criticism is attacked or proscribed is a recipe for policy paralysis. The really important initiatives will never achieve traction without an extensive reshaping of the larger discourse, in which criticism of the status quo is of central importance. In some ideal world, government is like a nice NGO. Everyone is imbued with a shared sense of what is good for the people, and all cooperate in harmoniously building a utopia. Conflicts melt away because everyone appeals to the common good. This is an idealized world of agitprop documentaries. Public choice theory encourages us to see that everyone involved in government works for herself, and all policymaking is marred by conflicts. Conflict is the normal state, and we should not be uncomfortable about it. Differences between persons and agencies are normal and healthy, and should be played out in the public domain. Differences arise out of conflicting interests, differences in information sets, and legitimate differences in how information is analysed.<br>

<br>Page 187
The protagonists of a conflict criticize each other. The media creates rancour by playing up conflict. We should disagree in polite language, maintain good personal relationships, and work through formal procedures for resolving conflicts. But we should be comfortable with conflict as the normal state. In fact, it is only in an authoritarian regime that conflict is squelched, as persons are too fearful to speak up. If two people agree on everything, only one is doing the thinking.The under-supply of criticismWe must recognize that in every society, there is a market failure in the form of an under-supply of criticism. Criticizing the government imposes costs upon the critic. The gains from criticism are diffused; the entire society benefits from the criticism. The self-interest of the critic leads her to ignore the gains forsociety at large, and thus to under-supply criticism. 3In July 2018, Xu Zhangrun, a law professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing wrote a tough review of the hard-line policies of Xi Jinping, the revival of communist orthodoxy and the adulatory propaganda surrounding Xi Jinping and the regime. Prof. Xu Zhangrun’s essay has text such as: ‘People nationwide, including the entire bureaucratic elite, feel once more lost in uncertainty about the direction of the country and about their own personal security, and the rising anxiety has spread into a degree of panic throughout society.’ Such writing by intellectuals is the essence of building a civilized society, and imposes positive externalities upon the Chinese populace. However, Prof. Xu Zhangrun is alone in facing the attacks from the regime. He has been suspended, barred from teaching, investigated andbarred from leaving the country. 4 The externalities do not accrue to XuZhangrun, while the costs do. A few academics are courageous and speak up like this, but most would prefer silence.<br>

<br>Page 188
This is similar to the standard economics argument about individual incentive leading to an underinvestment in higher education, as the decision maker does not value the spillovers, the positive externalities for society at large. When an Andrei Sakharov goes up against a regime, the critic instantly earns respect. When an individual goes up against a billionaire, the details are more intricate, billionaires are able to resort to tactics that governments cannot employ, and there is less moral clarity. There will thus be an even greater under-supply of criticism of billionaires. In a village economy, everyone knows everyone else, and economic relationships are efficiently organized under conditions of high information. In a modern market economy, however, many key relationships take place under substantial asymmetric information. In an environment where information is suppressed, there is greater fear about what lies beneath. This hampers trust and arm’s-length relationships. As an example, in 2012, the research firm Veritas Investment Research Corporation wrote a research report about a firm. Two years later, the authors of the report were taken into custody by the Gurgaon police. After such an event, arm’s-length investors became more concerned about the possibility that there is bad news about firms in India that is not being honestly revealed into the public domain.Voting turns conflict into better decisionsConsider a formal or informal meeting where multiple persons, with diverse interests, come into a room to make a decision. How can the conflict be channelled most effectively, so that the knowledge and the interests of all persons in the room are well represented and a good compromise is obtained? When multiple viewpoints come to the table, they are normally intermediated by informal systems of power. The persons in the room are all in a repeated game, and there is a give and take across many different<br>

<br>Page 189
elements of these relationships. It is all too easy for this process to collapse into an autocratic arrangement, where all power is placed with one or two people. Our cultural mores in India tend to give disproportionate power to the oldest or richest person in the room. The give and take which occurs in these informal meetings is part of a larger game between these individuals. A person may sacrifice the interests of a certain constituency in one particular meeting in return for pay-offs in unrelated settings. Each person who gets a seat on the table has the opportunity to non-transparently make certain trade-offs. In the limit, persons in the room sacrifice the interests of constituents or the public interest in return for personal gains. How can conflicts be channelled into better decisions? Formal voting systems are a great tool for improving the quality of the discourse. It is useful to think of three stages of a meeting. Stage 1 is an approximate statement of position, by various persons, and a free-format debate. Stage 2 consists of defining sharp propositions. Stage 3 consists of voting on them. What prevents persons in the room from arranging side payments in exchange for votes? Public disclosure of each vote, with a rationale statement, helps ensuring personal accountability of each person for the position taken. In India, two formal voting systems are in place: benches of judges in the judiciary, and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). In the MPC, the stage 2 is clear. Every meeting of the MPC has a narrow range of discrete choices that can be taken. In this case, the propositions that require voting upon are well understood. An MPC meeting then involves only stage 1 and stage 3. The Indian MPC has three votes for RBI staff and three votes for outsiders. When there is a tie, the RBI governor has a casting vote. This suffers from the problem that the two RBI staffers are likely to be deferential towards the third vote, which is the RBI governor’s. Thus, in effect, the governor controls the outcome of the MPC. A better design would have one vote for the RBI governor and four votes for independents. In that design, in order to have her way, the RBI governor would need to<br>

<br>Page 190
persuade at least two out of the four independents. This seems like a healthy reduction in the power of the governor. Decision making through a vote, with genuine dispersion of power, qualitatively improves meetings. When one or two persons dominate a room, others tend to be listless and uninterested. The knowledge and interests of all person are not vigorously brought into the room. When a certain set of persons have a vote each, each of them is fully energized to participate in the discussion, knowing that she has equal power and that her vote counts. This improves the very discussion that precedes the vote. When a meeting ends in a vote, everyone in the room thinks better and participates more. This idea can be used in a wide variety of meetings in order to improve the dispersion of power and the brainpower that is brought to bear on a question. Formal voting systems, backed by transparency, provide a powerful mechanism for aggregating knowledge and resolving political conflicts. Particularly in an early-stage liberal democracy, where the art of give and take in political negotiation is only weakly understood, formal voting systems can often mark a big step forward from the autocratic ways.Summing upWe should recognize the scarcity and value of criticism, and create an environment where we disagree without being disagreeable. Every critic is engaged in altruism, and harming her own self-interest, by speaking truth to power. There is a market failure, in the form of an under-supply of criticism owing to positive externalities. It is in the self-interest of the policymaker to engage with critics, so as to improve by discovering areas of weakness in the policy work. When the policymaker is short of time, meeting the critic is more useful than meeting a supporter. Conflict and negotiation is the healthy normal state of a liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is the endless search for a middle road.<br>

23Coming out right, always, is too high a barIn most situations, policymakers in India are excessively risk-averse. The phrase ‘policy adventurism’ is a lethal one, which can kill off any proposal. Policymakers would like to cultivate an image of being all-knowing, of occasionally championing an idea, and of coming out right every time. The incentives of officials tend to be asymmetric: success is not particularly important, but failure can be career threatening. There is a particularly harmful combination of low capabilities and low risk taking. When policymakers have poor knowledge, they are less confident. This creates a bias in favour of inaction. The fear of failure feeds into this bias for inaction, or for action in the form of campaigns on Twitter. To solve public policy problems, and build the republic, requires taking actions that involve risk. Real-world policymaking is extremely complicated. If we are very riskaverse, and move only when we are absolutely sure, this will generate excessive conservatism. This was a problem in the past, and this will be a greater issue in the future. In the past, Indian policy reform consisted of low-risk projects like dismantling industrial licensing and dismantling barriers to globalization. The analytical clarity on those issues was strong and there was little that could go wrong. But as these first-order ideas are used up, future policy work will not be as unambiguous. What is normal in the field of public policy is ‘complex systems failure’—where there are many moving parts and they came together in an unexpected way. Failure will happen, and when failure occurs, there is no<br>

simple concept of identifying the decisive mistake and the key person who made that mistake.Humility in publicWe must necessarily peer into the unknown when we choose between multiple solutions to a visible problem. In most cases, it is not entirely clear what solution is superior. To avoid paralysis, we have to be willing to make mistakes. This requires creating an environment that is more supportive of failure. We need to put aside the machismo, be honest in saying what we know and what we don’t know, and approach every policy initiative as a process of hypothesis testing. If a policymaker lays claim to omniscience and benevolence, this can lead to two outcomes. On one hand, the policymaker can be afflicted by hubris, and suffer from unintended consequences and failure. On the other hand, the policymaker may achieve a genuine understanding of the complexities that are faced, and retreat into paralysis owing to fear of failure that is incompatible with the public claims about omniscience. A key part of this is the allocation of credit. In authoritarian regimes, all achievements belong to the leader, which makes it difficult to ever admit that a mistake was made. When credit is given more accurately, to the cast of thousands that work on any one policy initiative, it is easier for the leadership to accept that things have not worked out well and to introduce course corrections. The best management culture is one in which we get credit for not taking credit. This helps create a healthy environment of trying things, accepting that some did not work, and abandoning or fixing the troubled ones. The mass media sensationalizes success or failure. It puts frail humans on a pedestal, and attributes godlike powers upon them. There is a need for greater maturity on both sides, in the media and in the policy community. Policymakers need to speak clearly about imperfect knowledge, and others<br>

<br>Page 194
need to recognize the trial and error that is required of any successful policy process. We start on a journey, and improve things based on criticism and empirical evidence. Bona fide errors are an integral part of any sound policy process. A policymaker who is not making mistakes is not trying hard enough. It is better for the policymaker to honestly depict the lack of knowledge, to speak openly about all policymaking as a research process, and to embrace the process of crossing the river by feeling the stones.A policy process that makes mistakes and learns from themWhen we insist that no mistakes were made, the process of learning stops. Wherever humanly possible, new policy initiatives should first be rolled out on a small experimental basis. This will create experience based on which we can make more rational moves in the future. And, if something does not work too well, we can back away from it without having suffered too high a cost. This is connected to an open and participatory process. If the policymaker claims to know how to cross the river, there is the danger of mistakes or inaction. If, on the other hand, the policymaker only claims to know how to feel the stones, and approaches the larger community with a sense of humility, this gives an environment that is more conducive to taking risks, learning from mistakes, and refining policy strategies based on evidence. The capability of the policy community is a resource, that needs to be nurtured. An approach of acknowledging the uncertainties, and discussing and drawing lessons from failure is the key to obtaining improvements inthe capability of the policy community over time. 1Summing up<br>

<br>Page 194
Bona fide errors are an integral part of any sound policy process. A policymaker who is not making mistakes is not trying hard<br>

<br>Page 194
enough.<br>

<br>Page 195
Officials of the Indian government tend to be averse to changing things. This is rooted in the bureaucratic incentives that penalize failure. In order to make faster progress, we need to create an institutional culture that is more accepting of failure. Part of the problem lies in the official line, which does not recognize or discuss failure. But most public policy work is characterized by failure, and we would all be better off by discussing this in a comfortable and realistic way. When a policymaker lays claim to omniscience, it is difficult to admit that a mistake was made. It is better to honestly speak about the uncertainties that are being faced, and embark on policymaking as a process of discovery.<br>

<br>Page 196
24A country is not a companyBefore 1991, most firms in India were managed poorly. We now have a large number of extremely well-run firms in India. The key persons in these firms are legitimately proud of their ability to run large complex organizations. Alongside this, we see the shambolic Indian state, which is unable to get the basics right. Can management skills and techniques carry over from the Indian private sector into government? Unfortunately, the skill and rhythm that is required in the public policy landscape is different from what works in for-profit firms.Government lacks feedback loopsAll big private firms are listed for trading on the stock market and see a stock price. The vast machinery of speculation in financial markets produces a real-time measure of the performance of the firm. Internally, private firms see operational management information system (MIS) statements that are updated daily. Revenue and profit are simple tools to distil the working of the firm down into a numerical yardstick. Are there comparable measures which can be used in public policy? Is GDP growth a good measure of how the government is faring? Later in this book, we show concerns about chasing the yardstick of GDP growth. In any case, in India, we are at the early stages of learning how to measure GDP. Is the performance of Nifty a good measure of how the government is faring? The movements of the stock market index express surprises in the<br>

<br>Page 197
outlook for corporate profitability; this is only weakly related to the achievements of the leadership. Is the rupee–dollar exchange rate a good measure of how the government is faring? The fluctuations of the exchange rate have nearly no link with how the country is faring. Depreciation is often beneficial for the economy. When a leadership starts viewing the exchange rate as a measure of its performance, this is generally harmful. There is thus no information system that generates feedback loops for government, in the way that accounting data and stock market data generates feedback loops in private firms.Government agencies are monopoliesThe customers of private firms generally have choices about whom they buy from. State agencies are generally monopolies. The only place that you can get a driver’s licence is a government office; the customer has no choice. The policy thinker Manish Sabharwal once said that RBI’s bond exchange, the Negotiated Dealing System (NDS), ‘has hostages, not customers’. Nobody chooses to be a member of the NDS, they are forced to use it. This diminishes organizational performance. The leadership of a private firm fears financial non-performance, which will ultimately lead to the loss of jobs and empire. Persistent weak performance can induce a sale of the firm to a new shareholder, who can impose painful changes upon the firm. Private firms face the threat of a bankruptcy process where the firm can be shut down or fundamentally reorganized. None of these possibilities influence employees in the government. There are rare events where a government agency is closed down. Politicians fear losing elections. Officials have no fear. The RBI was created in 1934. Consider the thousand-odd large private firms which also existed in 1934. By 2019, most of these firms had gone under, in the face of competitive pressure. The survivors (e.g., Tata Steel)<br>

<br>Page 197
There is thus no information system that generates feedback loops for government, in the way that accounting data and stock market data generates feedback loops in private firms.<br>

<br>Page 198
were unrecognizably different, in 2019, compared with their organizational capabilities of 1934. But the RBI of 1934 has survived into 2019 without facing any competitive pressure, while having small changes in its organizational capabilities. With private firms, we see something remarkable in the organizational culture of a Tata Steel or an IBM—firms that have managed to stay relevant over very long time periods. In government, in contrast, the oldest agencies are likely to have the most outdated internal arrangements.Government’s coercive power is qualitatively differentIn a private firm, the levers controlled by the management cover products, production processes and the internal organization of the firm. In government, there is similar decision-making power about the internal organization of government. But the surpassing feature of government is the monopolistic power to coerce. The state has a monopoly on violence. It is able to coerce private persons, either to pay taxes or to change behaviour. This yields a fundamental arrogance about state organizations, that private organizations do not suffer from. The puzzle of public policy lies in reining in employees who have the power to coerce, to prohibit, to raid and to imprison.Government has greater complexityA big firm in India has 25,000 employees. Compared with this, state structures are vast. Indian Railways has 1.3 million employees. Even if the efficient staffing at Indian Railways is half this size, it is a vast and complex organization when compared with what we see in the private sector.<br>

<br>Page 198
The state has a monopoly on violence. It is able to coerce private persons, either to pay taxes or to change behaviour. This yields a fundamental arrogance about state organizations, that private organizations do not suffer from. The puzzle of public policy lies in reining in employees who have the power to coerce, to prohibit, to raid and to imprison.<br>

<br>Page 199
The public policy process plays out not just through employees but through everyone, as coercive steps by the state induce changed behaviour by the people, which feeds back into the working of the state, and so on. This further increases the complexity of decision making. Policy decisions have to take into account the internal behaviour of large complex government organizations, and then the responses of the general public which in India’s case is above a billion people. This is a scale of complexity which is just not found in private firms.Government has to prize rules over dealsIn a private firm, there is ample room for discretion. The idea is to make many tactical decisions— ‘a hustle here and a hustle there’—that add up to profit. As an organization becomes larger and more complex, there is greater use of formal rules. In a ten-man firm, every decision is tactical. By the time we get to a 1000-man firm, there will be an HR policy that will shape and constrain HR actions. If a firm has three franchisees, each of the three contracts can be negotiated separately. But if a firm has a thousand franchisees, there will be a policy framework that determines a few standardized contracts that are applied in all settings. In government, this evolution towards rules is carried forward to an extreme extent. Given the unique features of government, it is pragmatic to work through policy frameworks and not tactical actions. We establish sound general frameworks, and work within them for a long time. We avoid transaction-specific decisions, even when we see a particular situation where the general policy is yielding the wrong answer. In addition, Article 14 of the Constitution of India requires the Indian state to treat identically placed persons identically. There is no such constraint upon private firms. Private firms can make deals, but states need rules.<br>

<br>Page 199
Government has to prize rules over deals<br>

<br>Page 200
Governments must disperse power<br>

<br>Page 200
Governments must disperse powerThe management of a private firm is often quite autocratic, partly because its internal staff is all that it controls. In contrast, public policy requires dispersion of power. The job description for a role in public policy is a package of policy knowledge, team building and nuanced negotiating ability. These are often elusive for persons with a background of leadership in autocratic firms. Successful governments feature a long and slow process of debate, negotiation and compromise. The leadership in the world of public policy requires the traits of listening, respecting and negotiating middle roads. This is a very different organizational culture when compared with what is found in most private firms. It is interesting to see that the organizational DNA in the largest and most complex firms veers towards the strategies of government. The largest and most complex firms have reduced power of the CEO, dispersed decisionmaking structures, and a greater emphasis on rules rather than discretion. The challenge of public administration lies in carrying this organizational evolution, from small firms to the biggest firms, further up a hundredfold.Governments operate on longer horizonsMany in the world of business have come to revere the alpine-style assault, where a firm builds something very big in almost no time. Instagram got to 10 million users in a year and was bought for $1 billion in two years. A world-straddling company like Google was only founded in 1998. Successful management teams are often imbued with the idea of saving time. The rhythm of public policy is quite different: to do good things requires a long slow ascent. Big sudden phenomena in the world of policy are generally harmful and/or failures.<br>

Summing upWe in India revere success and wealth, and there is a lot of respect for business folk. We tend to assume (say) that sound HR practices in TCS will work well in government. But we should be cautious when thinking about transferring expertise into the world of public policy. Companies have feedback loops where the daily MIS shows how things are faring, where quarterly financial statements are put out, and the stock price is updated in real time. When mistakes are made, they kick off corrections. Governments have no comparable feedback loops. Most firms operate in competitive marketplaces. When mistakes are made, they lose customers. Governments have hostages, not customers, and there is no choice. Firms wield no coercive power. They have to be nice to customers all the time. Governments wield coercive power. The danger of functionaries that mistreat individuals is ever-present. Process design for government organizations involves establishing checks and balances against this threat. Big firms are small compared with government organizations. A lot of decisions in private firms can be tactical. Governments become the most effective when they establish rules rather than discretion, and eschew day-to-day tactical responses. Governments are bound by equal treatment (Article 14 of the Constitution of India) while private firms have no such constraint. The management of a private firm is often quite autocratic. Successful governments, in contrast, do not have a CEO. Success comes from a long process of debate, negotiation and compromise. Firms tend to work on short time horizons. The best governments work on long time horizons. For all these reasons, the expertise on the working of private firms does not carry over into public policy, and vice versa. A country is not acompany. 1<br>

25System thinkingWhen a government gets involved in the working of society at the level of detail, this tends to go wrong. If a government is shaping products and processes, and favouring one technology over another, we are doing something wrong. If a government is ‘picking winners’—one firm over another, one industry over another, one technical standard over anotherwe are doing something wrong. We have to be sceptical about engineers bearing industrial policy. Social engineering works badly as the real world is too complex, intervention is ridden with unanticipated effects and state capacity is limited. The most advanced economies do the least industrial policy. The government should restrict itself to addressing market failure, while being mindful to only pick a few battles given its low capabilities. The economy and society should evolve as a self-organizing system, driven by the innovations of free men and women.Solving coordination problemsThere are, however, some situations in which there is a cautious case for ‘system thinking’ in public policy. System thinking addresses traditional market failures, in the form of asymmetric information, externalities and market power. In fields such as healthcare and pensions, where consumer behaviour may suffer from limited rationality, there is a greater case for system thinking. But it involves a new and daunting level of intrusive intervention, which goes well beyond the main work of public policy.<br>

<br>Page 203
Consider a two-way street where people face no restrictions. This will frequently yield traffic jams. When one person drives on one side of the road, this hampers incoming traffic on that side of the road. The adverse impact from one person to another works through channels other than market transactions and voluntary agreements. It is an externality. What is required in addressing the externality is a negotiation between many people, about who will use what parts of the road when, and a tidy solution is surely feasible. But it is difficult for all users of the road to find each other and negotiate such an agreement. It is important to see that there is no complex political economy in this negotiation. Nobody particularly gains or loses from rules of coordination; all we have is a pure Coasean transaction cost of putting people together and negotiating. A ‘Keep left’ rule, imposed by the state and backed by state coercion, nicely solves the problem of coordination by opposing traffic. It is a creative leap, a piece of system thinking, to envision this solution to the coordination problem. Does this smack of central planning? When a government imposes a ‘Keep left’ rule, we can think of this as solving this problem of negotiation. The citizenry has chosen representatives (legislators) who would undertake the negotiation on their behalf, and the outcome of this negotiation is ‘Keep left’.Coercive unbundlingEconomies of scope are about utilizing a customer relationship to sell an adjacent product, and about the reduced cost of producing an adjacent product. When governments use coercive power to prevent a firm from doing adjacent things, they are generally in the wrong. As an example, the Indian financial markets were forcibly cut up into three sub-industries: commodity futures, regulated by the Forward Markets Commission (FMC); equities and long-dated corporate bonds, regulated by<br>

<br>Page 204
the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (SEBI); and currencies, government bonds and short-dated corporate bonds, regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Firms in each silo were prohibited from doing business in the other two silos. This hampered economies of scale and economies of scope. In general, the coercive power of the state should not be used to hamper firms that exploit economies of scope. In some situations, however, bundling and tying raises concerns about a market failure in the form of market power. As an example, consider the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which has a dominant position in the brand awareness and distribution of insurance products. Suppose a new firm is born, with high skills in the production side of insurance products. This firm would not be able to reach consumers, as LIC has a lock on distribution and sales. LIC can get away with very poor manufacturing, as it owns the distribution. Using state power to force an unbundling, between manufacturing and distribution, can solve this problem. Consider the New Pension System (NPS). Project OASIS, led by Surendra Dave in 1998, saw that the overall pensions problem contained three distinct industries : managing money,owning customers, and record-keeping. 1 It suggested an unbundledarchitecture where pension fund management was separated from interaction with customers. Record-keeping was centralized at an information utility, to harness economies of scale, and to ensure that it was easy for consumers to switch from one pension fund manager to another. This design caters to heightened competition. On the strength of better fund management, a new pension fund manager can steal away customers, as switching is always possible. Similarly, the front-end firms would live or die based on their friendliness to customers, and not on the quality of their fund management. In the conventional world, finance professionals generally focus on the deal making required to get a new product to the customer. These finance professionals are a little shocked when, in the NPS environment, incumbent manufacturers do not control the distribution. All distributors are equally<br>

<br>Page 205
keen to push all products; all manufacturers have equal access to all distributors. Similar arguments are found in electricity where governments have pushed in favour of breaking up monolithic electricity utilities into three distinct industries: generation, transmission and distribution. This creates opportunities for entrants in generation and transmission. Until this unbundling was done, the firm that owned the distribution was the only game in town when it came to transmission and generation. Forcible unbundling backed by state coercion is a harsh intervention. What is an alternative, softer strategy? Suppose a new-generation company came up, and was denied access by an old-style integrated electricity utility. It could have used conventional competition law to litigate, and could have won, on the surface. However, there are too many levers, through which the monolithic utility could have rigged the game to disfavour the new entrant. It would take very high state capacity for a Competition Commission of India (CCI) to track down such misbehaviour and enforce against it. When state capacity is low, simple and transparent interventions are favoured. A simple unbundling rule is easier to articulate and enforce, when compared with the complexity of fighting with an integrated utility that is trying to hamper access to a new entrant. In the field of technology policy, at heart, net neutrality regulation is about forcing an unbundling between the content industry and the data pipes. The content industry is analogous to a manufacturer. What is best for society is that content firms slug it out against each other to produce better content. Under net neutrality, content firms are not allowed to do deals with the data pipes in order to create privileged distribution for themselves. Similarly, data pipe companies must slug it out against each other to give us fatter pipes at lower prices. But they are not allowed to do deals with content companies in order to create complicated bundles of content and pipes for customers. The separation protects competition in both industries. A firm that invents a new biscuit puts 10 per cent of its effort into the biscuit and 90 per cent of its effort into figuring out the distribution. Incumbents always have deep pockets, are entrenched in the distribution,<br>

<br>Page 205
When state capacity is low, simple and transparent interventions are favoured<br>

<br>Page 206
and try to choke off competitors there. Every practitioner living in this world treats these anti-competitive barriers as an everyday reality. The Internet is a unique open market; the moment a new shopfront comes up, it is instantly connected to all customers who are on the Internet. This implies superior competitive conditions when compared with the old economy. A new e-commerce firm puts 100 per cent of its effort into innovation, as it knows that all pipes are of equal access. Net neutrality regulation is aboutkeeping it this way. 2These examples are related to the common law concept of a ‘common carrier’, which is a firm that transports (say) goods in a non-discriminatory manner. The state coerces common carriers to force them to treat all customers equally.The need for caution in system thinkingSystem thinking is very attractive to engineers. Every engineer feels she can redesign society in certain ways that are good for everyone. But system thinking is fraught with danger. It is important to underline the use of state power, of the monopoly of violence that the state possesses, when policymakers do system thinking. When a government imposes a ‘Keep left’ rule, this is done by putting policemen in the street who impose punishments upon persons who drive on the right-hand side. System design in public policy is unlike engineering design done in a private firm. A private firm that designs a product tries to put it on the market, and if there is a lack of voluntary buyers, the firm loses money, realizes this was not a good design, and goes back into debating the next design. In contrast, when system design is done in public policy, the citizenry has no choice, the solution is forced upon them backed by threats of violence, and there is a limited chance of discovering that the design was a mistake.<br>

<br>Page 206
system thinking is fraught with danger.<br>

<br>Page 207
In the optimistic view, the engineer in the government is omniscient and cares about the welfare of the people. In the real world, both these assumptions are questionable. It is very difficult to think about design questions on the scale of society. Human systems reflect the interactions of a large number of sentient persons, and attempts at intervention are plagued by the law of unintended consequences. We may emphasize that social systems involve the interactions of many people, and envisioning these complexities requires knowledge of the social sciences and humanities, and not just engineering. Hence, the policymaker can easily be wrong. In addition, public choice theory reminds us that policymakers are just people, and are likely to pursue their own personal objectives, which may or may not align with welfare of the public. For these reasons, it is useful to approach system thinking with high scepticism, and use the coercive power of the state in reshaping society only rarely. For most situations, the self-organizing system that is the market economy works better. This reflects a trade-off between the cost of some situations where system design in public policy goes wrong versus the cost of some situation where the self-organizing system gets trapped in the wrong equilibrium. The self-organizing system works better than state-led design of society when state capacity is high. It is even more attractive when state capacity is low. When state capacity is low, there is a greater chance that state power will be used to impose the wrong designs upon society. There is a greater chance of this power being hijacked to serve an agenda other than public welfare. Hence, while mature market economies avoid system thinking, we in India should avoid it even more.How to do system thinking<br>

<br>Page 208
If system thinking must be done in the public policy process, how should it be organized? The first threat is that of the designers within government having the wrong design. To avoid this problem, a strong policy pipeline is required, with evidence, debate and the development of consensus in the expert community. If a design is made by any small group of people, without ample debate over elongated periods of time across a broad expert community, there is a greater risk of being wrong. As an example, in the international engineering community, many important technical standards have been developed by the ‘Internet Engineering Task Force’ (IETF). This is an open process through which rival firms, academics and enthusiasts are able to debate and develop standards. Such a process has a better chance of avoiding errors and of achieving democratic legitimacy. The second problem to address is the views of affected persons. A design that appears attractive to its creators might impose tremendous difficulties upon the economy. Broad-based consultation is required, with a large number of affected persons, in order to hear diverse views. Social systems are complex, and a design that appears clean to an engineer might induce unpleasant unintentional consequences for some individuals in society. As with all government intervention, it is important to clearly state the problem that is sought to be solved, define what constitutes success, and set up a measurement system to watch how the economy is responding to the initiative. It is important to be humble, to recognize when things have not gone as planned, and be ready to change course. A thumb rule that we would advocate runs as follows: Each policy thinker should permit herself a budget constraint of supporting no more than one policy proposal, that involves system thinking, in her life.Summing up<br>

<br>Page 209
Industrial policy works badly. Government should not pick winners. The purpose of government is to address market failure. A government should not be making decisions on which firm is better, what technology is better, or what technical standard is better. There are some situations where addressing market failure (asymmetric information, externalities and market power) can be done by using the coercive power of the state to design society. A ‘keep left’ rule, imposed by the government, brings order to traffic; it puts an end to the negative externalities of roads without such a rule. This can be rationalized as legislators engaging in a Coasean negotiation, and agreeing upon a contract that solves the problem of externalities. When a government engages in system thinking, and uses the coercive power of the state in order to impose a design upon society, there are many ways in which this can go wrong. In public policy settings, coercion is applied and there is no feedback loop through which the design is rejected by customers or improved in response to customer feedback. Social systems are very complex and there is a high risk of unintended consequences. Social engineering is thus difficult to do. The engineer may pursue objectives that diverge from the welfare of the public. The selforganizing system of the market economy generally evolves towards better solutions on its own. There are some rare situations when a certain touch of system design is useful. One of them is a forced unbundling between industries which improves competition. Net neutrality is the use of the coercive power of the state to force a separation between two industries: the content industry and the carriage industry. Firms that make data pipes only compete on how well their pipes work, and all content providers are able to carry their product on all pipes. Such non-discriminatory treatment by the pipes is related to the ‘common carrier’ principle in common law. System thinking is more important in contexts like health and pensions, where we are at the limits of the rational decision-making of the typical individual. If system thinking must be done, there are some good hygiene principles that are required. The development of the design must be done through an<br>

<br>Page 210
open process. The development of Internet protocols, through the IETF, is a role model for such an open process. Engineers may often tend to ignore the views of affected persons. Humanities and social science knowledge is of essence in thinking about questions from the viewpoint of the individual. Social engineering is fraught with danger. As a thumb rule, we suggest that each policy person should have a budget constraint of supporting one policy proposal, involving system thinking, in one life.<br>

26Beware the rule of officialsDuring World War II, the British rulers established extreme restrictions upon the Indian economy. After Independence, these evolved into a central planning system. From the late 1980s onward, this has morphed into an ‘administrative state’, the rule by officials who have fine-grained control over the decisions of private persons, with functions that veer into legislative and judicial roles. This involves excessive interference in the lives of private persons. However, for the major part, this is the structure of the Indian state, and to do public policy in India is to operate within the contours of this administrative state. Our first-order concern in Indian public policy is to improve state capability within this setting. It is useful, however, to re-examine the administrative state from first principles.The traditional case for strong contract enforcementLet us start at the objective of contract enforcement by courts. This is generally seen as being the foundation of business. Firms cannot contract with firms, and governments cannot contract with firms, if contracts are not honoured. Through this, an efficient and independent judiciary is an essential foundation of the market economy. Economists have, however, been relatively lukewarm about the importance of this contract enforcement. How does poor contract enforcement matter?<br>

<br>Page 212
Under conditions of weak contract enforcement, people would limit their contracting to friends and family. Repeated games would spring up, where good behaviour is optimal. There would be an efficiency loss, because markets would become less competitive. A new player would not be able to dislodge friends and family from one’s contracts. When contract enforcement is weak, firms would specialize less, there would be greater internal production and reduced use of contracting. This would adversely impact upon transactions and thus productivity.These effects are present, but they are not particularly large. In this first cut of the analysis, the adverse impact of poor contract enforcement is relatively limited. The role of the judiciary, however, runs much deeper: it impacts upon the very requirement for an administrative state in addressing market failures.Private solutions that solve market failureWhen person A inflicts a negative externality upon person B, this is termed a ‘tort’ in common law. Under common law, person B is able to go to court and ask to be compensated for harm. Many negative externalities can be handled through this mechanism. If person A faces the credible threat that person B can win damages, this will constrain person A’s behaviour. This would remove the need for a state apparatus to coerce person A in ways that do not harm person B. All that is required is the common law of torts, and courts that enforce this law. This pathway addresses a large part of the market failure associated with negative externalities and asymmetric information. This pathway breaks down when the courts do not work. What about the problem where the persons adversely affected are many? A factory may emit pollution which may harm many individuals, none of whom have adequate incentive to undertake the expenditure of litigation. This collective action problem is solved using ‘class action litigation’<br>

<br>Page 213
through which a group of people are organized to demand damages. This pathway breaks down when the courts do not work or when class action lawsuits are infeasible. This vision of enforcement relies on the aggrieved person taking recourse to courts. It involves private enforcement of law. As an example, if a person or a group of persons were adversely affected by securities fraud, they would gather evidence and sue. In this book, we have emphasized the power of private negotiation, as envisioned by Ronald Coase, for arriving at private solutions to many externality problems. These private solutions can flourish when, and only when, the courts are swift and competent. Otherwise, these contracts are not enforceable and the Coasean approach to addressing certain market failure is infeasible. In this perspective, a great deal of market failure can be addressed through contracts, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement. Looking back into Indian history, this pathway was ruled out when, after Independence, there were difficulties in judiciary.Example 31: SEBI’s monopoly on enforcing securities lawConsider the establishment of SEBI, during 1988–92. In the early drafting of the SEBI Act, it was felt that if private persons could sue, on the grounds of violation of securities law, there was a greater risk of harassment. Therefore, the SEBI Act, unlike the US Securities Act, prohibits private persons from suing for violations of securities law. Only SEBI has the right to initiate such actions. Victims of securities law violations do not have this right. Alongside this, India lacks a class action lawsuit mechanism, so there is no mechanism for (say) the shareholders of Satyam to sue. The design that was adopted in building SEBI was that only SEBI can initiate enforcement actions against a person. This is how we got to the administrative state. Now the difficulties of public management impact upon the enforcement<br>

<br>Page 213
the power of private negotiation, as envisioned by Ronald Coase, for arriving at private solutions to many externality problems. These private solutions can flourish when, and only when, the courts are swift and competent. Otherwise, these contracts are not enforceable and the Coasean approach to addressing certain market failure is infeasible.<br>

<br>Page 214
process. Thus, persons who have experienced harm are supplicants before SEBI, requesting SEBI to enforce securities law. Consider the judicial wing associated with regulatory actions. Securities regulators in other countries fuse the legislative and executive functions. They write regulations and they conduct investigations. But the cases brought by the securities regulator are heard in an ordinary court. In India, given the delays in judicial enforcement, we placed a judicial function at SEBI also. With this, the doctrine of separation of powers is absent in a regulator like SEBI. SEBI has become a very powerful organization, by the fusing of legislative, executive and judicial functions, and having a monopoly on enforcing securities law. In the memorable phrase of M. Sahoo, now chairman of the IBBI, regulators in India are ‘mini-states’. This concentration of powers hampers the emergence of state capacity.The policy possibilities for a country with high judicial capacityIndia today is at a polar extreme, away from mature common law jurisdictions, with the domination of the administrative state. We are weak on contract enforcement, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement. Organizations like SEBI are increasingly stepping into the shoes of the erstwhile central planning system. In the late 1980s and the 1990s, the leadership in the Ministry of Finance and in SEBI was engaged in building SEBI in a practical way. They treated courts as flawed and looked for ways to make progress. While such strategies are useful in the short run, at a deeper level, they have limitations. When power is concentrated at organizations like SEBI, these organizations will find it difficult to achieve state capacity. The detailed interference by the administrative state in the economy saps economic vitality. There is a need to rethink this construction of the administrative state, in order to set<br>

<br>Page 215
India on a path of sustained economic growth into becoming a mature market economy. The detailed licence–permit raj, and the fear of investigation agencies, are arguably at a peak in India today. How do we restore freedom? The agenda of liberalization and economic freedom requires going back to the foundations of common law: to a world of contracts, torts, private enforcement and class action lawsuits. This is what is required to scale back the administrative state. The traditional conception of economists on contract enforcement has been that courts are required to enforce contracts. When the courts fail in this, the implications are relatively modest: there is reduced specialization and there are repeated games. Our perspective, however, runs deeper. When the courts fail, we get the rule of officials. After Independence, we fared poorly on development of the judiciary. The coping mechanisms adopted by policymakers, in response to the failure of the judiciary, have their own harmful consequences. We need to address these failures at the root cause, through fundamental change in the judicial branch. We need to push back on the new central planning system, this administrative state, and graduate to a world of much greater reliance on the judiciary, a world of contracts, torts, class action lawsuits and private enforcement.Summing upThe ‘administrative state’ is the rule of bureaucrats. This is a state where the officials manning the executive creep into controlling legislative and judicial functions. In the administrative state, politics—the process of negotiation between interest groups—has a limited role. The Indian approach to central planning of the economy, where officials have considerable control over the life of private persons, is uncomfortably close to the administrative state.<br>

<br>Page 216
Economists have emphasized the role of the judiciary in contract enforcement, which enables the market economy. While contract enforcement is important, the more important role for judicial capacity lies in private solutions to market failure. Negative externalities can be solved through the law of torts, as long as litigation is efficacious. Many classic problems of asymmetric information, where we do consumer protection, can be addressed through torts. When many people are adversely affected in a problem like pollution from a factory, the collective action problem can be solved through class action suits. When private people are able to sue, and state agencies do not have a monopoly on enforcing laws, this reduces the reliance on state agencies for enforcing laws. The agenda of economic freedom in India is ultimately about scaling back the administrative state. This journey runs through great improvements in the courts.<br>

Part V The public policy process<br>

<br>Page 219
27Policymaking is siege-style assaultIn mountaineering, the climbers choose from two strategies. In the siegestyle assault, a large team establishes a base camp, which sets up the second camp and establishes the logistics for resupplying it, and so on. In the case of Mount Everest, there is a base camp at 5400 metres, camp 1 at 6100 metres, camp 2 at 6400 metres, camp 3 at 6800 metres and camp 4 at 8000 metres. Finally, from here, a few climbers try to get up to the top, which is at an altitude of 8848 metres. The siege-style assault is slow, expensive and reliable. In an alpine-style assault, on the other hand, there is none of this preparation. One or two people try to walk up at the fastest possible pace. When the alpine-style assault works, the result is always remarkable. But it requires superhuman capabilities, and the probability of failure is high. We think that the public policy process requires a siege-style assault. Every now and then, there are situations where an alpine-style assault yields some dramatic gains, but in time, these gains tend to be impermanent.Example 32: The UK policy process on in vitro fertilization (IVF)The world’s first test-tube baby, Louise Brown, was born in the UK on 25 July 1978. There was a great deal of hostility to the concept of a test-tube baby at the time. In 1982, the UK government established a committee headed by the moral philosopher Mary Warnock, to think about the associated public policy problems. The Warnock report was delivered in 1984 and led up to the ‘Human Fertilization and Embryology Act’ of 1990. This Act created<br>

<br>Page 220
the ‘Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority’ (HFEA) to adjudicate and license all work on human embryos, whether for IVF or for scientificstudy. 1How might things have worked out in the Indian policy process? We can see a few potential pitfalls:Right in 1978, when there was public criticism, there is a likelihood of a simple ban coming about. There is a bias, in India, for muscular responses to current newspaper stories. Letting the field unfold under laissez faire for four years is an unlikely event in the Indian policy process. As the securities expert Ashish Chauhan pleads, ‘First you have to have a market, and only then you can regulate it.’ If a committee had to be created, it would have been hard to find a moral philosopher to head it, as the humanities have atrophied in Indian universities. The translation of the report into the Act would have been done badly. The translation of the law into state capacity at HFEA would have been done badly.This example encourages us to see the full pipeline of the policy process, and work on strengthening all elements of it.The policy pipelineStage 1 of the policy pipeline is the establishment of the statistical system. Facts need to be systematically captured. Without facts, the entire downstream process breaks down. Our only hope for truth to matter is for truth to be recorded and widely disseminated. In the modern world, few actors in the economy have an incentive to do a good job of measurement. As an example, academic economists are quite comfortable doing research with faulty data, because the academic<br>

<br>Page 220
Stage 1 of the policy pipeline is the establishment of the statistical system.<br>

<br>Page 221
economists who will review their work do not ask questions about data quality. Stage 2 of the policy pipeline is descriptive and causal research. This requires a research community which will study the data, establish broad facts and regularities, and explore causal connections. This work should be primarily grounded in the Indian locale. Academic researchers are too often swayed by the curiosity of journal editors and referees in a different continent. This hampers the choice of questions to pursue and the quality of research design through which those questions are sought to be answered. Stage 3 of the policy pipeline is the creative phase of inventing and proposing new policy solutions. A large menu of choices needs to be at hand, for possible policy pathways. The republic is always short-changed when ‘there is no alternative’ (TINA) to one mainstream idea. At present in India, there is no community which systematically looks for fully articulated solutions. Academic journals do not publish policy proposals, hence academic researchers are not keen to invent policy proposals. Stage 4 of the policy pipeline is the public debate where rival solutions compete with each other. This requires a vigorous process of debate and discussion, in writing and in seminars. A broad consensus needs to come about on what will work, within the analytical community. In the Indian context, this is often assisted by the expert committee process. The purpose of the expert committee process is to sift through an array of possible policy pathways that are in the fray at the end of stage 3, and filter down to a few which make sense. The best expert committee reports help mainstream novel ideas in policy reform, and pull together the state of the art into a report. As Isher Ahluwalia says, nothing gets done by writing it in a government committee report, but nothing ever got done without it being repeatedly written into multiple government committee reports. Stage 5 of the policy pipeline is the internal government process of decision making. This is where ministers and senior bureaucrats take stock<br>

<br>Page 222
of the range of possible policy pathways and make decisions. This is the zone of political economy, and the creative trade-offs that make progress possible. Stage 6 of the policy pipeline is the translation of the decisions into legal instruments. Most policy decisions must be implemented through law that is enacted by the legislature, or subordinate legislation in the form of rules or regulations. High technical quality, and subtle detail, of this drafting process is of great importance. In India, all too often, the drafting of law is done by persons who have a superficial understanding of the prior stages of the policy pipeline, which leads to poor drafting of law. Finally, stage 7 of the policy pipeline is the construction of state capacity, in the form of administrative structures that enforce the law. Looking back into our history, the successful reforms in India were those that fared well on all seven elements of the policy pipeline. This, in turn, required capacity building in all the stages. It is only when there were human capabilities on all seven stages of the pipeline, and enough time had been given for working through these stages, that we got a sound reform.An alternative depiction of the policy processThe economist Satya Poddar has a different conception of the policy process, which is also illuminating. He thinks in terms of a four-part story:1. Defining the future state, or the preferred policy outcome, 2. Preparing a blueprint for the design and specification of the future state, 3. Defining the transition path from the current to the future state, and 4. Building political consensus or garnering public support for the change.<br>

<br>Page 222
Stage 6 of the policy pipeline is the translation of the decisions into legal instruments<br>

<br>Page 222
stage 7 of the policy pipeline is the construction of state capacity, in the form of administrative structures that enforce the law.<br>

<br>Page 223
These elements are intertwined and are rarely sequential phases in the implementation process. Yet, they serve as a useful framework for project management. The four parts require different skill sets. For example, we need visionaries and saints for the first element, who can rise above the morass of information, scientific knowledge and cacophony of self-interests. Preparation of the blueprint is science, engineering and public administration. A poorly designed transition path is often the main cause of policy failures, and thinking through a sound transition is more art than science. Consensus building is predominantly an art.The opportunity in crisisIt’s a mistake to believe that the change that has not yet come will never come. On 9/11 the world changed; on 10/26 the PATRIOT Act was passed. The Patriot Act was not written in 46 days. It was simply the instrument that was ready when the moment arrived. ‘Persuasive Language for Language Security: Making the case for software safety’, conference talk by Mike Walker, 24 May 2018The US politician, Rahm Emanuel, famously commented that ‘a crisis is a terrible thing to waste’. Crises are important events where the ‘Overton window’ is enlarged, and there is a larger zone of possibility in stage 5 of the policy pipeline. Policymakers should be alert to these opportunities. More generally, there is a lot to be said for a policy process where a community chips away at stages 1 through 4 of the pipeline, and waits for the right moment when stage 5 will use the ideas and stages 6 and 7 will use the human capabilities. The relationship between crises and reforms is, however, highly exaggerated. There are three contrary points of view that have to be kept in mind. First, the possibilities in a crisis are the product of previous work that has been done in the early stages of the pipeline, and the human capabilities for stages 5, 6 and 7 that have been built ahead of time. The apparently high<br>

<br>Page 224
marginal product of crisis is partly grounded in misattribution; a lot of the credit has to go to the investments by the policy community of previous years. When we see the correlation between crisis and reforms, we are exaggerating the role of the runner who carries the baton across the finish line. Investments in the early stages of the policy pipeline, and in human capacity, have to be in place. Otherwise, a crisis will be wasted. As an example, the rape in Delhi on 16 December 2012 created a political moment for reform of the criminal justice system. However, as the early stages of the pipeline had not been constructed ahead of time, and human capabilities for stages 5, 6 and 7 were weak, the response that was obtained in that terrible moment was weak. The second concern that has to be kept in mind is that when the range of possibilities is enlarged, this includes some very harmful ideas. We should not think that the leadership is always benign and intelligent. Crises are dangerous moments when placed in a fragile liberal democracy like India. Authoritarian rulers chafe against the checks and balances of a free press, the legislature, the courts and independent statistics. Democratic politics is about the hard work of negotiation, and when it works, heads of state routinely experience defeat. Authoritarian leaders find this a frustrating process; in fact they are often inexperienced in the culture of democratic law-making. They lack the temperament of sharing power, and are uncomfortable with the traditions of criticism and compromise. Crises offer aspiring authoritarians an escape from constitutional shackles. When security threats arise, it is easy to label all critics as antinational. When national security is at risk, the press, the courts and opposition parties are more deferential. We have numerous examples of crises that gave damaging outcomes. Hitler exploited the Reichstag fire in 1933. In Peru, an insurgency and economic crisis gave Fujimori the opportunity to dissolve the Constitution in 1992. Erdogan imprisoned thousands of opponents and intellectuals after a failed coup attempt in 2016. Indira Gandhi used the economic and political crisis of 1976 to declare Emergency.<br>

<br>Page 225
The confusion, anxiety, and the profound sense of bewilderment about market forces are inevitable when breadwinners must worry whether income will be enough next week to feed the family . . . You cannot think straight in the midst of hyperinflation. The society becomes unglued.Jeffrey SachsLet us shift gears away from a fundamental threat to the republic, in a crisis. When there is low state capacity, the day-to-day firefighting in a crisis can yield poor results. For example, India repeatedly had inflation crises in the past decades, and each inflation crisis triggered off a fresh batch of harmful command-and-control measures. The reform which actually matteredinflation targeting through the Monetary Policy Framework Agreement (MPFA) of 20 February 2015—was not triggered off by an immediate inflation crisis. Similarly, RBI produced seventy-four regulations in the first fifty days after the demonetization of 2016, and these crisis-management actions were not RBI’s finest hour. The 2013 currency crisis had sustained policy activism over a period of months, with many adverse effects upon theeconomy. 2 Given weak institutions in India, we should dread a crisis.The third concern is that focusing on opportunities for reform in a crisis tends to understate the value and possibilities from incremental reform. A lot more is possible from the slow process of improving things every day, than is commonly given credit for. The UK got to liberal democracy without anything like a French Revolution. We should not be entranced by dramatic wins; we should have the endurance to engage in ‘the slow boring of hard boards’ over long decades. In India, it is often argued that deeper reform will only come about in a crisis. A flip side of this belief is a demoralized view that under normal circumstances, policy reforms are infeasible. We see the policy process as a process of building knowledge and conducting hypothesis tests every day, and we dread a crisis.Example 33: The reforms of 1991<br>

<br>Page 225
weak institutions in India, we should dread a crisis.<br>

<br>Page 226
The reforms of 1991 are linked, in the minds of many, to the balance of payments crisis and consequential IMF conditionality. A closer examination of that period, however, shows the policy pipeline that was established through the 1980s and made this possible. The decades in which India grew at 3.5 per cent, while East Asia did much better, had made an enormous impression upon the policy community. The intellectual foundations of the 1991 reforms were laid by Jagdish Bhagwati, Padma Desai, T.N. Srinivasan, Arun Shourie, Manmohan Singh, Anne Krueger, Ashok Desai, Montek Ahluwalia, and the other pioneers of market-oriented policy thinking in India. The government committee process had established key pillars forreform, including the Dagli Committee on controls and subsidies (1979), 3the P.C. Alexander Committee on import-export policies and procedures (1977), the Abid Hussain Committee on trade policy (1984), and the G.S. Patel Committee on stock market reform (1984). By the late 1980s, there was a community of key persons in a dozen ministries who were envisioning a market-oriented India. There was an entire community that was ready to play a leadership role in economic reforms. Indeed, it was the ideas of this community which were written into the IMF conditionalities of 1991. If these elements of the policy pipeline had not been in place, ahead of time, the crisis of 1991—on its own—would not have induced the positive changes that it did. For a contrast, Pakistan has had twenty-one loans from the IMF from 1958 to 2019, but lacked the policy community and the early stages of the pipeline, through which these moments of crises could be turned into accomplishments for policymakers.Assessing the state of maturity of the reforms process in a field<br>

<br>Page 227
For people who take interest in a field in India—e.g., agricultural reformit is useful to score the state of maturity at each of the seven stages, every year. At each link in the chain, we should ask: What is the state of knowledge, literature and community? Can we identify ten highly capable persons (of all ideological persuasions) in each stage of the pipeline? A field is in poor shape on stages 1, 2 and 3 if we are not able to envision ten wise persons who can usefully be members of an important expert committee (at stage 4). This classification system can be used to systematically identify the weak links in the chain in a field of interest, and strengthen those.Capacity building for the Indian policy processThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. Chinese proverbCapacity building for Indian policy reform requires fostering capabilities in all seven stages. Successful reforms tend to take place when there is maturity in all the seven areas. Activities that do not fit in the pipeline have limited usefulness. Alpine-style assaults are a high-risk strategy; they will often fail or be reversed. The pipeline flows from left to right, and therefore there are prerequisites. The early stages have to be complete for the late stages to fare well. A systematic strategy of identifying the gaps—e.g., ‘in field X, there is a particularly important weakness at stage 3’—can lead to constructive strategies to address these gaps. The seven elements help us think about areas that are ripe for reform versus those that are not. The first four stages of the pipeline are of particular interest. When these early stages are strong, there is a possibility of making significant progress in actually doing reforms. The leadership which finds itself in such a situation should thank the people who put in the requisite investments, in previous years, to build the early stages.<br>

<br>Page 228
When these early stages are weak, there is little opportunity to achieve significant reforms. It is quite inexpensive, to nurture these stages of the pipeline, and create reform opportunities for the future. But when a leadership is short-sighted and skimps on this nurturing, this has harmful effects in ways that are not visible at the time.Summing upProgress in policy involves a pipeline that runs from data to research to multiple policy proposals to public debate about rival proposals to decisions to legal instruments to implementation. If we use the key ‘|’ to denote a pipe then the policy pipeline is data | research | proposals | debate | decisions | legal instruments | implementation. This is a slow, siege-style assault. There is a widespread beliefs that crises are an ideal opportunity for reforms. However, crises are difficult times. If the pipeline is not mature, ahead of time, in the heat of the crisis it is not possible to overcome the gaps in knowledge and human capacity. When crises enlarge the range of possibilities, this includes some harmful ideas. Checks and balances are less effective in a crisis. Things can more easily go wrong. Institutions that are weak in normal time<br>

<br>Page 228
times are unable to deal with the day-to-day events of a crisis. We should dread a crisis. For a given field (e.g., property rights), it is useful to formally assess the state of capability in each stage of the policy pipeline. Each stage requires mature knowledge and a strong community. This will help guide the most valuable subsequent actions that need to be undertaken to obtain reform in a field.<br>

<br>Page 234
States are generally able to intervene in society in three ways. Coercive power can be used to modify the behaviour of private persons, which constitutes regulation. States can produce certain services. Finally, states<br>

<br>Page 235
can finance the purchase of certain services by private persons from private producers. The organization design required for each of these three pillars is quite different. A funding organization is very different from a regulating organization, which, in turn, is very different from a producing organization. State production creates incentives for light regulation of public sector production, an attempt at monopolizing public resourcing for only public production, and attempts at utilizing the regulatory power to create entry barriers that impede private production. Where possible, it is better to operate regulatory and financing pillars and not a production pillar<br>

<br>Page 236
Sequencing discussions in India often degenerate into choosing low hanging fruit to begin the work, and proclaiming that an important reform has begun. Sophisticated thinking on sequencing involves five elements:1. Capacity building in the policy process: We have shown seven elements of the policy pipeline. There is a natural sequencing, going from left to right, of the order in which actions should be undertaken. 2. Prerequisites: When x is a prerequisite for y, we have to get x in place before y. 3. Learning by doing: Start with simple problems, learn public management, and gradually escalate complexity. 4. Political economy considerations: Weigh the gains and the costs imposed by various alternative components, and take the ones with high economic gain but low political cost first. Early moves should create a constituency for the late moves. Early moves should not walk into a political economy trap. 5. Stinginess: Start on a low scale on coercive power and spending, escalate only when capabilities are proven.<br>

<br>Page 240
Simple problems are those that involve a fewer number of transactions, less discretion, low stakes and less secrecy.<br>

<br>Page 248
The policymaker has to do many things. In what order should they be done? Too often, in India, policymakers pick one of two easy things, ‘the lowhanging fruit’, and after that the reform peters out. Doing the easiest thing first is generally not the optimal sequencing. The policy pipeline shapes sequencing. If the data is lacking, it will not be possible to make progress on policy design. Therefore, when the data is lacking, the first thing in the sequencing should be improvements in the data. In the working of real-world systems, there are prerequisites. An inflation-targeting central bank will require a capable bond market, in order to do the monetary policy transmission. Reforms of electricity generation will not work if the electricity distribution does not work. We have to identify these choke points and solve them first. State capacity does not come about easily. It is better to solve easy problems first, that put us on the path to higher state capacity in the future. Capability emerges out of the process of learning-by-doing. This calls for low transaction-intensity, less discretion, low stakes and less secrecy, at the early stages. It is important to think through the political economy. This is not just about buying out the persons who lose from a reform. The early steps should create gainers who will then support and sustain the reform. In the early stages of building the republic, low coercive power should be given to government organizations, particularly the powers to raid, investigate and punish. Through this, we reduce the stakes. Only after high success is achieved, in wielding low coercive power, can there be a discussion about whether higher coercive power is desirable.<br>

<br>Page 249
In India, we are often seeing a negative spiral. An agency has excessive coercive power, and so it fails in its work, but the political response to failure generates greater coercive power for the agency, which further reduces capability. The right response to failure by an agency should be a reduction in its coercive power.<br>

<br>Page 251
Sweden gets a central bank done in 360 employees, but we may require 720 people in a central bank, as low state capacity induces greater inefficiency. Here, the cost pertains to financial resourcing but even more to the scarce time of the policy leadership<br>

<br>Page 251
Doing policy under conditions of low state capacity is about making decisions where prices are higher and budget constraints are smaller. The deeper question lies in how to increase state capacity. How can a country put itself on the journey to increasing state capacity, so that over time, the cost of undertaking a certain activity goes down, and the aggregate resources available to the state go up?<br>

<br>Page 253
The Indian state should not just be a mini-Swedish state. There would be many zeroes in the Indian optimization: We would try to go after a smaller set of market failures, where the welfare cost of the free market outcome is particularly large, and where the state capacity required in addressing the market failure is relatively small. Given our capacity constraints today, to quote Kaushik Basu, we have to engage in ‘libertarianism of necessity’.<br>

<br>Page 253
When state capacity is low, there is a greater chance of making mistakes. In this case, the damage that can be caused by a more intrusive action by the state is greater.<br>

<br>Page 253
When we live in a low-state-capacity environment, there is a greater chance that the government is wrong. In this case, we should favour small moves, small powers for the government, small punishments, small sums of money. The bigger and more dramatic the action, the greater is the harm inflicted upon society when government is wrong.<br>

<br>Page 254
Do fewer things<br>

<br>Page 254
There is a lot to gain by paring down to a smaller set of priorities, focusing upon them, and making genuine progress. If the scarce resources —of money and man-hours of key persons—could focus on a small set of important problems, we would get a lot more done. Along the way, we would learn how to own and operate a state.<br>

<br>Page 255
The virtue of simplicity<br>

<br>Page 255
Under conditions of low state capacity, the only safe place to be is to have no tax-exempt bonds. If a subsidy has to be paid, it is best to do this through the expenditure programmes of government, where there will be better scrutiny of the relative magnitudes of expenditures.<br>

<br>Page 260
If we were in Sweden, we would do normal public economics: We would identify market failure and address it. If we live in a country with low state capacity, how does this change our thinking? In the international experience, waging war was an important pathway to developing state capacity. That pathway is not open to India, given the nuclear deterrent. When there is low state capacity, there is a bigger chance of state power being used in wrong ways. Therefore, it is wise to use coercion mildly. When state capacity is low, tax rates should be low, expenditures on public programmes should be low, the investigative powers of the agencies should be low and the punishments that are encoded into laws should be low. When state capacity is low, we should design simple interventions that are easy to implement. A single-rate GST makes lower demands of state capacity, in the annual process of making the budget and in the everyday process of tax administration. The weak state has highly limited resources of money, of the time of capable staff, and the management time of the leadership. Rather than spread this widely, it makes more sense, under conditions of low state capacity, to attempt doing fewer things. How to choose these fewer things? One useful test is whether there is a market failure. Many things should not be done, as they do not address market failure. The core of any state is four elements: the criminal justice system, the judiciary, tax collection and financial regulation. Without these, there can be no economy. Hence, these four areas should be the limited areas of focus. We should learn how to run a state by building capability in these four areas.<br>

<br>Page 261
Rolling up your sleeves to build state capacity<br>

<br>Page 261
There are two temptations that need to be avoided. The first is the pleasure of solving one small problem<br>

<br>Page 261
The second temptation that should be avoided is the great man theory of history.<br>

<br>Page 262
It is better to have a bicameral legislature, and different clocks for the selection of representatives in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, in order to avoid the possibility of a momentary infatuation of voters inducing concentration of power<br>

<br>Page 263
It is better for any one industry to be answerable to many masters ranging from income tax law to competition law to sectoral regulation. If an industry is excessively dominated by one regulatory agency, this generally yields poor outcomes owing to the concentration of power.<br>

<br>Page 264
We need to take public choice theory to heart, and thereby bring sound procedures into law where agencies and personnel are mistrusted with power, so as to produce better performance by the state apparatus.<br>

<br>Page 264
Clarity of purpose of the agent<br>

<br>Page 264
High-performance agencies are those with clear objectives, sound design of the organogram and sound processes.<br>

<br>Page 265
However, agencies should be set up with narrow, technical and non-political functions.<br>

<br>Page 265
Delegate whatever you can<br>

<br>Page 265
This rearrangement is termed ‘agencification’ in the field of new public management. The principal should contract out everything that can be contracted out, in this fashion. After this is done, the work of the department splits into two tracks:1. Contract management for each of these relationships; and<br>

<br>Page 266

<br>Performing, within the department, all the difficult functions which are not easy to specify, where there are political complexities, which are not mere technical problems.<br>


<br>Page 266
The principal–agent relationship will only work correctly when the principal stays engaged in the work of the agent and engages in contract management as specified in the relevant legal instrument. This will require capacity and resourcing at the principal.<br>

<br>Page 267
Three elements of wisdom are useful in designing sound agency arrangements. The separation of powers doctrine argues that it is better to separate legislative, executive and judicial powers across three distinct organizations. To the extent that more than one of these is brought into a single organization, there is concentration of power, which inevitably leads to abuse of power.<br>

<br>Page 267
the rule of law is also a tool for achieving state capacity. When there are failures on the rule of law, this places arbitrary power in the hands of officials and politicians. This leads to abuse of power and low state capacity.<br>

<br>Page 267
The third element of wisdom is about the powers of an agency. At the outset, it is important to give low powers to an agency. Government agencies should have low levels of direct and indirect coercive power. This includes the power to raid a person, the power to tap phone conversations, the power to spend money, the power to punish a person, etc. Power corrupts, and the greater the power of the personnel<br>

<br>Page 268
The law that establishes an agency requires six key elements:1. Clarity of objective: Accountability can only come about when there is clarity of purpose. Vague, multiple or conflicting objectives cater to corruption and incompetence. 2. Formal processes for legislative functions: The law must write the due process through which the agency wields the power to write law. 3. Formal processes for executive functions: The law must write the due process through which the agency performs executive functions like licensing and investigation. This is analogous to the role of the Criminal Procedure Code in binding the police to how they function. 4. Formal processes for judicial functions: The law must write the due process through which the judicial functions are performed. There must be a hearing, the person conducting the proceedings must be unconflicted, orders and penalties must be reasoned, and an efficacious appeal must be possible. 5. Reporting and accountability: The agency must release enough information about its own functioning so as to be held accountable for its use of public resources and wielding the coercive power of the state. 6. Board: The law must write the role and structure of the board. The board must have a majority of non-government members, who must hold the management accountable; and the board must control the design of the organization. A majority of outside directors is essentialin switching the strategic conversations from loyalty to voice<br>

<br>Page 269
the bad outcomes that we see in India flow from badly drafted laws.<br>

<br>Page 269
Establish a leadership<br>

<br>Page 269
We have low state capacity when there is no leadership that thinks in this fashion, when the organization has a fixed budget year after year, and the organization is impervious to information. There are no feedback loops, and the organization has stopped thinking.<br>

<br>Page 270
Containing discretion<br>

<br>Page 271
Formal processes, embedded in the law, are the prerequisites for wielding discretion, which is the prerequisite for state capacity.<br>

<br>Page 274
When there is one practical error that has taken place in one government organization, we should generally resist the impulse of solving it. We should go deeper. Why did intelligent and well-meaning people make such a mistake? What was the structure of incentives that led them to this mistake? This leads us to the question of organization design. Recruiting famous people or skilled people will not change the organization design. Building state capacity will not come out of hiring Indian Administrative Service (IAS) or non-IAS or private people. Government works better when there is dispersion of power. A great deal of failure comes from a few individuals controlling excessive power. Checks and balances are key. The drafting of law involves two key elements. First, law authorizes the coercion of private people. Second, the law must address the principalagent problem between the citizen and the state. An array of checks and<br>

<br>Page 275
balances must be built in, when drafting the law, in order to address public choice concerns, to create accountability mechanisms. Government departments in India are overloaded with many tasks and it is hard to reform this. ‘Agencification’ will help. Establish an organization outside the department, give it a clear objective, and hold it accountable. Departments must contract out, to such agencies, all technical functions which can be contracted out through well-specified laws. Once this process is complete, the work inside the department will consist of (a) participating in the governance of the external agencies, and solving the principal–agent problem between department and agency, and (b) all the unexpected things and political problems, which could not be contracted out. ‘Agencification’ will work better when there is a great focus upon rule of law, separation of powers, and low coercion. Agencies must have low powers of investigation, punishment, spending, etc. Only after an agency is proven as having high levels of state capacity can a slow process of giving more power be evaluated. We should only get up to UK-style or Swedishstyle powers and punishments when we get up to UK-style or Swedish-style<br>

<br>Page 275
state capacity. The law that sets up an agency must have clarity of purpose, formal processes for legislative-executive-judicial functions, reporting and accountability, and correct design of the composition and functions of the board. About 140 sections of law, which set up this machinery, is found in the draft Indian Financial Code, version 1.1. Agencies can sometimes collapse into everyday practical activities, and a loss of strategic thinking. Functionaries would show up to work every day and do the same work that they did the previous day. The board and the top management of the agency have to provide leadership. This involves a feedback loop of taking in information, developing a situational awareness, and undertaking actions that deliver the mandate of the agency. This is related to the teeth-to-tail ratio problem: if an agency is only paying salaries of front-line field operatives, it is all teeth and no tail, it has lost the ability to think.<br>

<br>Page 276
Discretionary power is routinely abused in the Indian state. The answer is not to remove all discretion. If there is no ability to see the world, and choose the right response, there can be no state capacity. The answer lies in establishing formal procedures with the rule of law, so that discretion is contained in checks and balances. Administrative law is thus at the heart of the Indian journey. Building a bridge requires money and time. From the decision to build the bridge to the inauguration, it takes a long time. In similar fashion, building an agency requires money and time. Merely hiring a few people and renting an office do not give a working agency. When a fledgling agency is asked to do work, this is premature load bearing and it generates an organizational collapse. When reforms have to be brought to existing agencies, the incumbent officials resent reductions in their arbitrary power. They argue that if a policeman has to go to a judge and get a warrant before entering a home, we will fail to catch criminals. But it is only in a police state that a policeman’s job is easy.<br>

<br>Page 278
In India, our public policy capabilities are highly circumscribed by the unavailability of data. This creates the need for informal information channels. In an ideal world, we would like to have statistics and analytical models. In our reality in India, our ability to undertake formal economic analysis on many problems is limited.<br>

<br>Page 279
a country becomes great when men plant trees that they will not live to enjoy the shade of, a country becomes great when men and women initiate data-gathering efforts that they will not live to enjoy the fruits of.<br>

<br>Page 281
The only trusted measurement system is one that is continuously scrutinized, criticized and refined<br>

<br>Page 282
Two useful principles to think about data release are:1. If something can be obtained using the Right to Information (RTI) Act, it should be released pre-emptively. We should progressively expand the scope of items under ‘duty to publish’ of the RTI Act. 2. If a data set was created using public funding, it should be released into the public domain in machine-readable form, while taking care to mask identifying information that would harm the privacy of private persons.<br>

<br>Page 283
A great deal of data in India is of low quality. This includes data that is produced by government agencies and the official statistical system. All official data cannot be trusted. We must take great interest in the methods and administrative difficulties, of each data source, before deciding to use it. There are many coping mechanisms. Policy design can plan to discover prices through auctions, rather than assume that adequate information is available up front. There is a greater role for qualitative research, given the weaknesses of quantitative research. Every policymaker must kick off long-range improvements in measurement. The most valuable thing, for the Indian policy process, is sustained measurement, and not one-off measurement. When a phenomenon is measured, again and again, we develop the long-term time series, and the observation of many units and many geographical locations. These are the most useful data sets of the country. Government needs to release much more information in the public domain, particularly record-level anonymized micro data. What can be obtained through the RTI Act should be published. Data that is made using public money should always be released to the public. The private sector and the research community will do good things with data files, the only thing required of the government is to release the micro data.<br>

<br>Page 284
The safe strategy in public policy is to incrementally evolve—making small moves, obtaining feedback from the empirical evidence, and refining policy work in response to evidence. This process requires the construction of trusted data sets. It also requires intellectual capabilities in analysing this information and feeding knowledge back into the policy process. It<br>

<br>Page 285
The privilege of giving policy advice, and being part of the policy process, should be limited to the persons who achieve the status of public intellectuals, through writing and speaking in the public domain, and earning respect for honesty and knowledge.<br>

<br>Page 287
What is the problem that we see? Is it a market failure? What is the lowest cost intervention? Do the benefits outweigh the costs? How do we build state capacity for achieving this intervention?<br>

<br>Page 288
The ultimate purpose of an academic institution in India is to acquire metis, create authentic knowledge about India, to diffuse knowledge into India, and to be part of the process of changing India.<br>

<br>Page 289
Knowledge institutions shape the discourse. Complex reforms, such as the GST or inflation targeting, cannot be achieved as a palace coup; they require a shift in the entire discourse. Sustained work by large numbers of intellectuals in knowledge institutions is essential to achieving the new level of thinking. Every policymaker will benefit by setting up a few knowledge partnership contracts, and take effort to make them work. In the short term, they are low-cost initiatives. In the long run, these will yield a qualitatively superior trajectory of the policy process. This approach needs to be applied in all parts of government. Whether it is in Karnataka or in Shimoga, policymakers require capable knowledge institutions, which are steeped in the local context, and develop metis. The intelligentsia in public policy is derived from the broad foundations of the humanities and social science knowledge that is made in the universities. In India, public investments in the universities have emphasized science and engineering and neglected the humanities and social sciences. Building the republic requires capabilities in the universities—in the humanities and the social sciences.<br>

34Building the perfect GST in a low-capacity stateMany of the themes of this book come together in the GST reform. What is the best path to the GST? From the viewpoint of state capacity, it makes sense to start with a low single rate. This is the easiest GST to implement, as it is administratively simple and the incentives for evasion are lowest. To make this concrete, consider the possibility of a single flat rate of 10 per cent GST with a comprehensive base. This draws on the global wisdom that the right way to do a GST is to have a single rate. A single 10 per cent rate applied on 70 per cent of the economy yields 7 per cent of GDP as tax revenue, and even if we actually obtain a part of this, we are broadly okay. At this low rate, it would have been possible to avoid all exclusions. Petroleum products could have gone in, real estate could have gone in. To many of us in India, a single rate appears sharply different from the present arrangements. It is always possible to layer non-VATable sin taxes on top of the basic GST, which would serve as Pigouvian taxes. Individual state governments can choose how they wish to think about alcohol taxation. A carbon tax can potentially be layered on top of the GST. A state like Sikkim, which prizes environmental protection, may impose a sin tax on plastic consumption. We should decouple our thinking between two distinct problems: a single-rate GST and a collection of non-VATable sin taxes. The distortion associated with a tax rate goes up in proportion to the rate squared. Hence, the low value (10 per cent) would have gone with a reduced distortion, and thus enabled a higher level of GDP. The marginal cost of public funds would have come down. Government (at all levels) is<br>

We should decouple our thinking between two distinct problems: a single-rate GST and a collection of non-VATable sin taxes.<br>

<br>Page 293
with this 10 per cent rate and the rate will not go up, and all of us will be the beneficiaries. The 10 per cent rate would have induced optimism on the part of the domestic and global private sector. India would have earned respect worldwide for having capabilities in policymaking. This would have fostered investment and thus GDP growth. In the first two years, significant resource reallocation would have started taking place, with firms discovering more efficient ways of working. This would have fed back into higher GDP growth and thus tax revenues. If these first two years had worked out well, that would be a triumph. If tax revenues were stubbornly low, the rate could have been raised from 10 per cent to 12 per cent. The right sequencing is to take on a harder problem (a higher tax rate) later in the game, as this requires greater state capacity. There is an interesting and self-stabilizing phenomenon associated with a large tax shortfall at the 10 per cent rate. Suppose it became clear that 10 per cent was not going to work, that the rate was likely to go up to (say) 12 per cent next year. Households would see this and increase their<br>

<br>Page 294
consumption, knowing that prices would go up in the future. This would give buoyant business-cycle conditions, and enlarged consumption, whichwould partly offset the difficulties. 1Summing upThe principles of this book suggest that the right way to design the GST is a single rate, a low rate, a comprehensive base, with an elegantly simple administrative system.<br>

35Health policyPrevention versus cureThe founding intuition of the field of health policy is the tension between prevention and cure. Policymakers always face two rival pathways in health policy: of utilizing incremental expenditure or coercion for the purpose of preventing ill health versus utilizing incremental expenditure or coercion for the purpose of healthcare. In India, too little has been done by way of prevention, so the gains from incremental effort in prevention are substantial. Consider road safety. When a person suffers from a road accident that is not fatal, there are three consequences: (a) Pain and unhappiness; (b) If the affected person is a worker, there is the loss of output and possibly income on account of reduced days of work; and (c) Expenditures on healthcare. Given that India has some of the highest rates of road accidents in the world, on the margin, prevention seems better than cure. We are better off with fewer road accidents, rather than having casualties and then supplying the commensurate healthcare services. A little general equilibrium intuition is useful in thinking about a world where fewer people require healthcare. If road safety in India was improved, there would be fewer jobs in trauma centres. The resources which go into producing healthcare, for a preventable accident, are reallocated by society when accidents are prevented. Healthcare production requires labour and capital in order to produce ambulance services, trauma centres, medical supplies, etc. In a world with fewer accidents, these resources get reallocated into producing goods and services that people<br>

<br>Page 296
actually like, such as movies and clothes. When accidents are prevented, not only does society reduce expenditure on healthcare, we become better off because those same resources are shifted to producing things that people actually want. A world with fewer road accidents is thus one where some individuals experience less pain and suffering, there is less lost output, and society gains happiness as some resources switch from producing healthcare services to producing things that people actually like. At Indian levels of road safety, this is better than producing healthcare services to address the problem of road accidents. There is something awkward in counting the production of healthcare services, associated with preventable problems, as part of GDP. When air quality in India gets worse, there is greater purchase of healthcare services, and GDP as conventionally counted goes up. This detracts from the notion of higher GDP as synonymous with higher consumption and choice in the hands of the people. In a good country, we would spend less on healthcare as fewer people would get sick. We suspect that GDP will become a better measure of consumption and welfare if the healthcare expenditures, associated with preventable events, are subtracted from GDP.The case for state intervention in healthThe standard recipe of public economics is to start from conditions with no state, and identify the market failures. What goes wrong when we have pure laissez faire, when the government does nothing about health? There is a neat split between two classes of market failure.Public health: Consider the eradication of smallpox in India in 1975. 1 Once smallpox waseliminated, everyone gained welfare: this joy is non-rival and non-excludable. Controlling communicable diseases, and controlling sources of ill health such as road safety or natural disasters—these are public goods. The second class of market failure in the field of health concerns externalities. Pollution of water or air, and the impact of one infected person upon another, involve negative externalities. Here also, there is market failure and thus a case for state intervention.<br>

‘Public health’ is defined as the population-scale initiatives that address externalities and provide public goods<br>

<br>Page 297
‘Public health’ is defined as the population-scale initiatives that address externalities and provide public goods. Public health mostly involves prevention and not cure: it obtains a healthier population through reduction in sickness. In contrast, most healthcare involves private goods and not public goods. There is a great deal of confusion around terminology in this field. There is a need for a sharp delineation between four phrases: ‘public good’, ‘market failure’, ‘public health’ and ‘healthcare’. The phrase ‘public health’ is often misunderstood to mean ‘healthcare’. Many think that ‘public health’ is the health of the public. Conversely, it is often incorrectly assumed that ‘healthcare’ is a ‘public good’. The phrase ‘public health expenditure’ is often applied for government expenditures on healthcare, and it is particularly confusing because it contains the phrase ‘public health’ which is the antonym of ‘healthcare’. The phrase ‘government healthcare expenditure’ is unambiguous and thus preferable. Many of the advanced economies of today have been engaged in public health for a very long time. As an example, the UK began work on clean water in 1858 and on clean air in1952. 2 In many aspects, the public policy initiatives that address externalities and public goods in health are in place, in advanced economies. 3 As a consequence, there is limitedinterest in public health in the contemporary policy debates of advanced economies. But in countries such as India, public health is not a solved problem. There is often an inappropriate transfer of concepts and priorities, from the health policy debates of advanced economies, into Indian thinking about health policy. This has given a certain loss of focus upon public health in India. In 2018, the World Health Organization began a ‘Common Goods in Health’ (CGH)initiative. 4 The attempt here is to bring back a focus upon the population-scale policy actions,i.e., addressing externalities and providing public goods, in health policy. The phrase ‘Common Goods in Health’ is unambiguous, and may help reduce the confusion associated with the phrases ‘public health’, ‘public goods’, ‘healthcare’ and ‘market failure’.Healthcare: India has drifted into a largely unregulated private healthcare market. Most healthcare services are purchased from private doctors and hospitals. The private healthcare market suffers from the other two kinds of market failure: asymmetric information and market power.People respond to incentives. Doctors are people. Doctors respond to incentives.The economic analysis of the behaviour of doctors and hospitals yields great insights. In some ideal world, doctors are altruistic. However, in the real world, the behaviour of doctors is shaped by their self-interest and the objective of revenue maximization. There is extreme asymmetric information between a doctor and a patient. When a doctor says that a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is required, the patient is likely to comply. When the MRI laboratory pays a kickback to the doctor, as is common in India, medical malpractice arises. Prices of healthcare tend to skyrocket when individuals are unable to engage in comparison shopping for healthcare services with predictability of expenditures.<br>

<br>Page 298
In a simple for-profit setting, the incentive of the doctor is not to heal the patient. The incentive of the doctor is to extract maximal revenue. Alongside this, it is efficient to make the patient feel subjectively better. This is done by over-prescribing antibiotics, by prescribing steroids (that briefly make a person feel better), by having a good bedside manner, by earning likes on social media, etc. Such strategies do not heal, but they generate more referrals. In a simple for-profit setting, there is no incentive for the doctor to guide the patient into pathways that prevent future requirements of healthcare. Public policy initiatives are required to address these market failures in healthcare.The Indian journeyUnder colonial rule, there was an emphasis on the public goods of sanitation and communicable disease. A government committee, led by Sir Joseph Bhore from 1943 to 1946, envisaged a shift in focus from public health to healthcare, and advocated a government-run healthcare system. This was an extremely influential report, and shaped a large reorientation ofhealth policy in the following decades. 5By the 1980s, it was clear that these modifications were working poorly. The disease burden was high, owing to weaknesses in public health. Thegovernment-dominated healthcare system was working poorly. 6 Individualswere increasingly resorting to private healthcare. Politicians became increasingly aware of the unhappiness of individuals. Ideally, these difficulties should have generated a fresh focus upon public health. However, building capabilities in public health is difficult. To have tens of thousands of health workers, all over India, who fight mosquitoes, is a difficult problem in public administration. Health policy in recent decades has instead taken the path of least resistance—to use public money to buy insurance (often from private health insurance companies) for individuals who would obtain healthcare servicesfrom private healthcare providers. 7 This is an inefficient path in three ways:Weak public health gives a high disease burden, there is market failure in the private healthcare industry, and there is market failure in the healthinsurance industry. 8<br>

<br>Page 298
Weak public health gives a high disease burden, there is market failure in the private healthcare industry, and there is market failure in the healthinsurance industry<br>

<br>Page 299
There is a need to revive public health, and reduce the extent to which persons require healthcare. Ironically, the weaker the healthcare system, the greater the gains from prevention.<br>

<br>Page 299
The focus of health policy in India must be upon prevention, i.e., upon public health. This includes immunization, disease vectors such as mosquitoes, monitoring of disease outbreaks and fighting epidemics, drug safety, food safety, air quality, water quality, waste management, disaster risk resilience, disaster response, etc. These areas require prioritization and the development of state capacity.<br>

<br>Page 299
Ministry of Health. As an example, air quality is a key public health crisis that afflicts north India. However, the problem of air quality lies in the Ministry of Environment and not the Ministry of Health. Public health considerations need to shape the working of many ministries. As an example, the Indian road safety crisis is a first-order challenge for public health. The agencies building and operating roads should carry targets for accident rates and not just targets for kilometres of highways built.Policy pathways in healthcareAt present, we face a difficult situation in healthcare. The public sector is not effective at translating expenditures into healthcare services. Privately produced healthcare is afflicted with market failure. Health insurance<br>

<br>Page 300
companies suffer from poor financial regulation (of insurance) and from dealing with a malfunctioning healthcare system. Greater government spending on healthcare is popular. At present, there are two pathways for this increased expenditure. More money can be put into government healthcare facilities such as primary health centres (PHCs) or government hospitals. Alternatively, more money can be put into health insurance companies who intermediate between individuals and private healthcare providers. Both these pathways work poorly. As a consequence, the welfare gains from increased government expenditure on healthcare, under the present paradigm of healthcare, are likely to be low. The key insight lies in system thinking, in re-imagining the contractual relationships to achieve incentive compatibility. Imagine a contract between a network of healthcare providers and the patient which underwrites all healthcare for the patient for life, in exchange for fixed monthly payments. This must be not just one doctor, but a network of providers that covers all aspects of healthcare. When you get sick, you would go to your healthcare network, and they would render you healthcare services, at no additional cost. Such networks are called ‘Health Maintenance Organizations’ (HMOs). Once this style of contracting is done, the incentives of the healthcare producer change. Now, the HMO is paid by you every month, and these payments are clean profit for them, until you get sick. When you get sick, you impose costs upon them. They have no incentive to over-prescribe procedures, and their incentive is to keep you healthy. Now the HMO has the incentive to ask you to come in for regular checkups, so that problems are caught early. At all ages, immunization will be pushed by the HMO, so as to avoid the costs associated with illness. The choice of treatments will be done with a view to keeping you healthy. At present, the conversation between a doctor and a patient in India is a transactional one, where symptoms are described and treatments are explained. The time in that room is a powerful opportunity to change behaviour. A few minutes spent by the doctor evangelizing better behaviour tends to have a significant impact on behaviour and health. As an example,<br>

<br>Page 301
A doctor in an HMO who sees a surge of an infectious disease in her neighbourhood would have the incentive to talk with public health officials, and initiate public health responses which address the epidemic at the root cause. This is incentive-compatible as the HMO makes more money when fewer people get sick.<br>

<br>Page 301
state capacity. The UK government is able to make sure that GPs show up to work, and are conscientious about their work even though this is a transaction-intensive, discretion-intensive service. Under present Indian conditions of state capacity, this is infeasible, outside of islands of state capacity such as AIIMS. Addressing these difficulties of healthcare requires system thinking. It is hard to see how the self-organizing system of the market economy will find the HMO solution. The present structure of incentives encourages doctors to earn super normal incomes by over-prescribing procedures and thus earning revenues and kickbacks. This is analogous to the emergence of the New Pension System in the context of money management. Left to itself, the private sector finds it hard to break away from the toxic sales practices of insurance companies and mutual funds, and the supernormal fees charged by fund managers who do not add value.<br>

<br>Page 302
At the same time, system thinking is a highly difficult problem in public policy; at low levels of state capacity it is too easy for central planning to emerge with the wrong answers. A tremendous amount of work is now required, in policy thinking on healthcare in India, to find the right pathways for system design, while recognizing that system thinking is a difficult problem in public policy.The correlation between GDP and healthIn the international experience, when a country gets richer, the health of the population improves. This is a strong correlation. However, like all correlations, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between the two. In some respects, we can see how becoming richer enables better health in India. As an example, a richer family would have better nutrition, and be able to spend more on private healthcare. A richer family would generally have higher education, and better knowledge feeds into better health. However, there are also many elements in India, where increased prosperity has harmed the disease burden. As an example, we now have the new challenges of air quality and road safety, which are harming people today, which were not present a few decades ago. We should not assume that higher GDP growth will always give us improvements in the health of the population, in line with what has happened on average in the international experience. That average international experience is predicated on sophisticated health policy thinking, that has come about in each country as the country achieved a greater intellectual capacity in public policy. We in India will need to achieve an improved intellectual capacity, in public policy work on public health and on healthcare, in order to obtain the full translation of higher GDP into improved health.<br>

<br>Page 303
Summing upHealth policy is one of the hardest parts of public policy. The toolkit of market failure and state capacity gives us important insights into the field. There is a neat and vertical split between two classes of market failure (public goods and externalities) that shape the field of ‘public health’ or ‘common goods for health’ and the other two classes of market failure (asymmetric information and market power) that shape healthcare. We in India need to change course. Under the present trajectory, GDP growth is inducing greater ill health through problems such as pollution, natural disasters and road safety. In the government, public health capabilities have atrophied: we do worse on critical problems like vector control when compared with many decades ago. Voters are unhappy, and the government is trying to subsidize their purchase of private healthcare services from a private healthcare system that suffers from extensive market failure. Thinking about market failure and state capacity from first principles is required in public health and in healthcare. As in many other fields, there is a lot of interest in technological fixes for health policy. There is undoubtedly great opportunity in using better technology, ranging from mundane process automation using better data handling, all the way to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that will replace doctors. However, the foundation of beneficial technology adoption lies in incentives. Our first priority has to be to address the foundations: to reorganize health policy around the problems of market failure and state capacity. Under each of the two wings—public health and healthcare—a research community is required and the full policy pipeline is required. We need to establish data sets, develop a research literature, incubate diverse policy proposals, debate them, develop a mature point of view on how the problems will be solved, present these choices to legislators, enact new laws, and then build the state capacity to enforce these laws. Health policy is a less mature field in India, in the development of the policy pipeline,<br>

 <br><br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/legacy/papers/lightman.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://web.mit.edu/comm-forum/legacy/papers/lightman.html" target="_blank">The Role of the Public Intellectual</a><br>Hi  <br>Excellent question. The answer really depends on your context. Young researchers &amp; new entrants to the field will have different requirements from people who have spent more time in any area.  <br>My general recommendation is:  <br>
<br>Read at least three newspapers a day: international, national &amp; regional. You won’t need to read everything, but scan through the front page of the website to get an overall picture and zoom into articles that attract your interest. Avoid algorithmic feeds everywhere  
<br>Subscribe to newsletters of your choice using a different email address (eg. I use mailto:<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:nitin.pai.reader@gmail.com" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="mailto:nitin.pai.reader@gmail.com" target="_blank">nitin.pai.reader@gmail.com</a> to receive all newsletters). Look at the Takshashila newsletters for instance. If you choose wisely, you’ll get distilled wisdom from people who’ve done the hard work of processing news &amp; developments.&nbsp;  
<br>Similar to #2 subscribe to RSS feeds of blogs. There still excellent blogs out there. In fact if you use a newsreader app, then you can even read substack newsletters on them.&nbsp;  
<br>Assign one or two days a week to read magazine content: Economist, The Atlantic, Frontline, etc  
<br>Use physical, ebooks &amp; audiobooks to your advantage. Most of my leisure reading (fiction) is usually on audiobooks. I get around 1 hour extra per day by listening to audiobooks while walking the dog or commuting to work.&nbsp;  
<br>Similar to #5: listen to podcasts.&nbsp;  
<br>What not to do:  <br>
<br>Avoid television. The best place to keep your TV is outside the window. When throwing it out of the window, please make sure it does not hurt anyone below. Especially if you live in a high rise apartment.  
<br>Avoid over-engagement on Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp etc. These are bad for your mental health.  
<br>Avoid news addiction. You don’t need to follow the “news” as much as you think.&nbsp;  
<br>Avoid getting stuck in reading. If a book or paper is too boring, skip it and move to something else. Don’t feel guilty over unread books.

<br>Abstract
The debt position of the state governments in India, which deteriorated sharply between 1997–1998 and 2003–2004, has witnessed significant improvement since 2004–2005. Debt sustainability analysis based on empirical estimation of inter-temporal budget constraint and fiscal policy response function in a panel data framework, covering 20 Indian states for the period 1980–1981 to 2015–2016, indicates that the debt position at the state level is sustainable in the long run. The increase in contingent liabilities of states and take-over of large chunk of these liabilities through debt restructuring of State Power Distribution Companies, however, would adversely affect the debt position of states.

Results of the structural break unit root test clearly indicate that all the three variables, namely liabilities, expenditure and revenue receipts, as a% to GSDP are stationary at level i.e., I(0) with the inclusion of a structural break in the model. Stationarity of liabilities at level indicates the sustainability of public debt of Karnataka. As argued by Jha and Sharma (2001), if public expenditure and revenues are I(0) as in the present case, public debt is sustainable.

<br>Abstract
Debt sustainability is an essential attribute of good macroeconomic policies but its precise definition is elusive and its assessment is even more challenging. The IMF has developed a sophisticated approach but it must be recognized that, because the future is unknown, any debt sustainability assessment is only valid within the bounds of the underlying guesses. There is no support for the view that added complexity allows for more precise assessments. As a consequence, policy conclusions drawn from debts sustainability exercises must be considered with care. Sacrificing growth – in the short and even in the long run – to imprecisely known risks can be very costly.
<br>Summary

<br>Imported: 2024-07-28 04:16<br><br>Highlight (<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="zotero://open-pdf/library/items/CKTVWTQQ?page=29&amp;annotation=LFGMUDUS" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="zotero:\\open-pdf\library\items\CKTVWTQQ?page=29&amp;annotation=LFGMUDUS" target="_blank">p. 29</a>)
The horizon should be long, say ten years. As argued in Section 3.3, debt corrections are best carried out slowly, with small changes in the primary account maintained over a long period. Debt corrections are inherently costly, the costlier the sharper they are. The same effect, if sustained, can be achieved at a much lower cost if it is spread on many years.

A number of countries have taken steps to improve their policy-making institutions in the area of fiscal policy, with much success so far. Brazil and Chile, for instance, have adopted formal procedures that bind policy actions within a framework that put debt sustainability at the forefront. Most East Asian countries have informally done so, relying on norms instead of legal arrangements. Mechanical DSA, as discussed in the present paper, implicitly take institutions as given, while CPIA does so explicitly.
