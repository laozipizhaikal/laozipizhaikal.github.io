<p dir="auto"><em>As a $3-trillion economy, India is on her way to becoming an economic superpower. Between 1991 and 2011, the period of our best growth, there was also a substantial decline in the number of people below the poverty line. Since 2011, however, there has been a marked retreat in the high growth performance of the previous two decades. What happened to the promise? Where have we faltered? How do we change course? How do we overcome the ever-present dangers of the middle-income trap, and get rich before we grow old? And one question above all else: What do we need to do to make our tryst with destiny? As professional economists as well as former civil servants, Vijay Kelkar and Ajay Shah have spent most of their lives thinking about and working on these questions. The result: In Service of the Republic, a meticulously researched work that stands at the intersection of economics, political philosophy and public administration. This highly readable book lays out the art and the science of the policymaking that we need, from the high ideas to the gritty practicalities that go into building the Republic.</em></p>

<li data-line="9" dir="auto"><strong>Principal–agent problems</strong><br>
Government organizations contain the hardest management problem. How do we obtain good behaviour from employees that wield coercive power, while lacking good measures of performance, and having no threat of organizational extinction?</li>
<li data-line="11" dir="auto">Three cross-cutting problems that are found in all organizations are human resource management, the financial process and the procurement process.<br>
In Indian system these are not established</li>
<li data-line="13" dir="auto">In every organization, there are front-line producers and then there is an enormous overhead of monitoring, measurement, management and strategy.”<br>
A low teeth-to-tail ratio is required for the organization to work well. Too often, in India, we have organizations which are all teeth and no tail.</li>
<li data-line="15" dir="auto">Politics without romance<br>
we used to think of the state as a pristine, benevolent actor who would work for the best interests of the people. Now we think about the incentives of politicians and officials, who pursue their own personal objectives.<br>
This intuition was formalized in the field of ‘Public Choice Theory’ which used economic analysis to think about the objectives of politicians and officials</li>
<li data-line="18" dir="auto"><strong>The yearning for heroes</strong><br>
The objective of reform is not to hire saints, but to achieve a state which yields good outcomes when each actor is self-interested.<br>
<em>Example:</em> The fruit of the poisonous tree - The lack of this doctrine in India—the implicit belief that policemen are benign persons who mean well—is a major source of arbitrary power and thus the abuse of power by enforcement agencies in India.</li>
<li data-line="21" dir="auto"><strong>Who will mind the minder</strong><br>
Public choice theory encourages us to think that all officials and all politicians are cut from the same cloth. We have to construct systems of checks and balances, that will work through rational incentives of all parties, and without assumptions that any one person is a saint.”</li>

This involves understanding who will lose in the short run, negotiating with them and influencing their view of the world, modifying the reform in non-fundamental ways so as to reduce the pain upon these persons, and sometimes compensating them through other instruments.

There should be a sustained process of engagement with think tanks, academic institutions, data sets and intellectuals, in order to cogitate about what is going wrong. The emphasis in an opposition party should be not just on criticizing what the ruling party has done, but on developing a set of plans for what would be done when in power. The incumbent ruling party equally faces this problem. At year 5, a successful ruling team is jaded, and an unsuccessful ruling team is demoralized. Yet, it needs to think through the possibility of re-election, and find the energy for transition planning. This preparatory work would be particularly valuable when it is fed into the manifesto of the political party and, when coalition governments are formed, the negotiation for a common minimum programme. The paragraphs in such documents matter disproportionately, but receive inadequate attention ahead of time. Long-range thinking and capacity building are required in each political party to develop the capability to succeed in the event of winning elections. When such developmental work is not done, ahead of time, we translate remarkable election outcomes into failures on policy.</p></div></div></div><div class="heading-wrapper"><h2 data-heading="Playing the long game" dir="auto" class="heading" id="Playing_the_long_game"><div class="heading-collapse-indicator collapse-indicator collapse-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon right-triangle"><path d="M3 8L12 17L21 8"></path></svg></div>Playing the long game</h2><div class="heading-children"><div><p dir="auto">A cult of jald baazi is taking root in India.

We suffer from a strong pace of personnel changes, which prevent the development of knowledge and rapport within policy teams. We suffer from three-page notes of individual reform measures, typically written by interested parties, which lack strategic thinking. We fluctuate from one topic to another, based on the crises that engulf us each day. When a government flits from one issue to the next based on the news cycle, there is no strategy.

In a liberal democracy, the relationship between the policymaker and the individual is not the relationship between a ruler and a subject. The policy process is a process of negotiation.

Confident policymakers work in the open. Working in the open signals capability. The most harmful events are those where a policy announcement shows up on a website in the evening, without any prior warning, and is effective next morning. The best episodes are those with an open consultative process, where the legal instrument showing up on the website is a non-event, and there is ample lead time between the date of announcement and the date effective.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Criticism and conflict have great value<br>

Criticizing the government imposes costs upon the critic. The gains from criticism are diffused; the entire society benefits from the criticism. The self-interest of the critic leads her to ignore the gains for society at large, and thus to under-supply criticism.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Formal voting systems, backed by transparency, provide a powerful mechanism for aggregating knowledge and resolving political conflicts. Particularly in an early-stage liberal democracy, where the art of give and take in political negotiation is only weakly understood, formal voting systems can often mark a big step forward from the autocratic ways.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">We should recognize the scarcity and value of criticism, and create an environment where we disagree without being disagreeable. Every critic is engaged in altruism, and harming her own self-interest, by speaking truth to power. There is a market failure, in the form of an under-supply of criticism owing to positive externalities. It is in the self-interest of the policymaker to engage with critics, so as to improve by discovering areas of weakness in the policy work. When the policymaker is short of time, meeting the critic is more useful than meeting a supporter. Conflict and negotiation is the healthy normal state of a liberal democracy. Liberal democracy is the endless search for a middle road.”</p></div><div><p dir="auto">To solve public policy problems, and build the republic, <em>requires taking actions that involve risk</em>. Real-world policymaking is extremely complicated. If we are very risk averse, and move only when we are absolutely sure, this will generate excessive conservatism. What is normal in the field of public policy is ‘complex systems failure’—where there are many moving parts and they came together in an unexpected way. Failure will happen, and when failure occurs, there is no simple concept of identifying the decisive mistake and the key person who made that mistake.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">This requires creating an environment that is more supportive of failure. The best management culture is one in which we get credit for not taking credit. This helps create a healthy environment of trying things, accepting that some did not work, and abandoning or fixing the troubled ones.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">need to recognize the trial and error that is required of any successful policy process. We start on a journey, and improve things based on criticism and empirical evidence. Bona fide errors are an integral part of any sound policy process. A policymaker who is not making mistakes is not trying hard enough. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">It is better for the policymaker to honestly depict the lack of knowledge, to speak openly about all policymaking as a research process, and to embrace the process of crossing the river by feeling the stones.  </p></div><div><p dir="auto">When we insist that no mistakes were made, the process of learning stops.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Wherever humanly possible, new policy initiatives should first be rolled out on a small experimental basis. This will create experience based on which we can make more rational moves in the future.And, if something does not work too well, we can back away from it without having suffered too high a cost. This is connected to an open and participatory process.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If the policymaker claims to know how to cross the river, there is the danger of mistakes or inaction. If, on the other hand, the policymaker only claims to know how to feel the stones, and approaches the larger community with a sense of humility, this gives an environment that is more conducive to taking risks, learning from mistakes, and refining policy strategies based on evidence. The capability of the policy community is a resource, that needs to be nurtured. An approach of acknowledging the uncertainties, and discussing and drawing lessons from failure is the key to obtaining improvements in the capability of the policy community over time. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">Most public policy work is characterized by failure, and we would all be better off by discussing this in a comfortable and realistic way. When a policymaker lays claim to omniscience, it is difficult to admit that a mistake was made. It is better to honestly speak about the uncertainties that are being faced, and embark on policymaking as a process of discovery.”</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The skill and rhythm that is required in the public policy landscape is different from what works in for-profit firms. <em>Government lacks feedback loops</em> There is thus no information system that generates feedback loops for government, in the way that accounting data and stock market data generates feedback loops in private firms.<br>
Government agencies are monopolies The customers of private firms generally have choices about whom they buy from. State agencies are generally monopolies. The only place that you can get a driver’s licence is a government office; the customer has no choice. This diminishes organizational performance.<br>
The leadership of a private firm fears financial non-performance, which will ultimately lead to the loss of jobs and empire. Persistent weak performance can induce a sale of the firm to a new shareholder, who can impose painful changes upon the firm. Private firms face the threat of a bankruptcy process where the firm can be shut down or fundamentally reorganized. None of these possibilities influence employees in the government. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">There are rare events where a government agency is closed down. Politicians fear losing elections. Officials have no fear. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">In government, in contrast, the oldest agencies are likely to have the most outdated internal arrangements. Government’s coercive power is qualitatively different In a private firm, the levers controlled by the management cover products, production processes and the internal organization of the firm. In government, there is similar decision-making power about the internal organization of government. But the surpassing feature of government is the monopolistic power to coerce. The state has a monopoly on violence. It is able to coerce private persons, either to pay taxes or to change behaviour. This yields a fundamental arrogance about state organizations, that private organizations do not suffer from. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">The puzzle of public policy lies in reining in employees who have the power to coerce, to prohibit, to raid and to imprison.

This further increases the complexity of decision making.

The job description for a role in public policy is a package of policy knowledge, team building and nuanced negotiating ability.  Successful governments feature a long and slow process of debate, negotiation and compromise. The leadership in the world of public policy requires the traits of listening, respecting and negotiating middle roads.<br>

The most advanced economies do the least industrial policy. The government should restrict itself to addressing market failure, while being mindful to only pick a few battles given its low capabilities. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">The economy and society should evolve as a self-organizing system, driven by the innovations of free men and women. Solving coordination problems There are, however, some situations in which there is a cautious case for ‘system thinking’ in public policy.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">System thinking addresses traditional market failures, in the form of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Asymmetric Information" data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="notes/asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">asymmetric information</a>, externalities and market power. In fields such as healthcare and pensions, where consumer behaviour may suffer from limited rationality, there is a greater case for system thinking. But it involves a new and daunting level of intrusive intervention, which goes well beyond the main work of public policy.”</p></div><div><p dir="auto">In general, the coercive power of the state should not be used to hamper firms that exploit economies of scope. In some situations, however, bundling and tying raises concerns about a market failure in the form of market power. As an example, consider the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), which has a dominant position in the brand awareness and distribution of insurance products. Suppose a new firm is born, with high skills in the production side of insurance products. This firm would not be able to reach consumers, as LIC has a lock on distribution and sales. LIC can get away with very poor manufacturing, as it owns the distribution. Using state power to force an unbundling, between manufacturing and distribution, can solve this problem. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">When state capacity is low, simple and transparent interventions are favoured. A simple unbundling rule is easier to articulate and enforce, when compared with the complexity of fighting with an integrated utility that is trying to hamper access to a new entrant. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">“When state capacity is low, simple and transparent interventions are favoured”</p></div><div><p dir="auto">thinking is very attractive to engineers. Every engineer feels she can redesign society in certain ways that are good for everyone. But system thinking is fraught with danger. It is important to underline the use of state power, of the monopoly of violence that the state possesses, when policymakers do system thinking.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">when system design is done in public policy, the citizenry has no choice, the solution is forced upon them backed by threats of violence, and there is a limited chance of discovering that the design was a mistake.”</p></div><div><p dir="auto">“system thinking is fraught with danger.”</p></div><div><p dir="auto">It is very difficult to think about design questions on the scale of society. Human systems reflect the interactions of a large number of sentient persons, and attempts at intervention are plagued by the law of unintended consequences. We may emphasize that social systems involve the interactions of many people, and envisioning these complexities requires knowledge of the social sciences and humanities, and not just engineering. Hence, the policymaker can easily be wrong.<br>
In addition, public choice theory reminds us that policymakers are just people, and are likely to pursue their own personal objectives, which may or may not align with welfare of the public.<br>
<em>For these reasons, it is useful to approach system thinking with high scepticism, and use the coercive power of the state in reshaping society only rarely.</em> </p></div><div><p dir="auto">For most situations, the self-organizing system that is the market economy works better. When state capacity is low, there is a greater chance that state power will be used to impose the wrong designs upon society. There is a greater chance of this power being hijacked to serve an agenda other than public welfare. Hence, while mature market economies avoid system thinking, we in India should avoid it even more. How to do system thinking”</p></div><div><p dir="auto">If system thinking must be done in the public policy process, how should it be organized?<br>
The first threat is that of the designers within government having the wrong design. To avoid this problem, a strong policy pipeline is required, with evidence, debate and the development of consensus in the expert community.</p></div><div><p dir="auto"><em>Each policy thinker should permit herself a budget constraint of supporting no more than one policy proposal, that involves system thinking, in her life.</em> </p></div><div><hr></div><div><p dir="auto">When contract enforcement is weak, firms would specialize less, there would be greater internal production and reduced use of contracting. This would adversely impact upon transactions and thus productivity. These effects are present, but they are not particularly large. In this first cut of the analysis, the adverse impact of poor contract enforcement is relatively limited. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">Economists have emphasized the role of the judiciary in contract enforcement, which enables the market economy. While contract enforcement is important, the more important role for judicial capacity lies in private solutions to market failure. <em>Negative externalities can be solved through the law of torts, as long as litigation is efficacious</em>. Many classic problems of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Asymmetric Information" data-href="Asymmetric Information" href="notes/asymmetric-information.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">asymmetric information</a>, where we do consumer protection, can be addressed through torts. When many people are adversely affected in a problem like pollution from a factory, the collective action problem can be solved through class action suits. When private people are able to sue, and state agencies do not have a monopoly on enforcing laws, this reduces the reliance on state agencies for enforcing laws.

A large menu of choices needs to be at hand, for possible policy pathways. The republic is always short-changed when ‘there is no alternative’ (TINA) to one mainstream idea. At present in India, there is no community which systematically looks for fully articulated solutions. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">Stage 4 of the policy pipeline is the public debate where rival solutions compete with each other. This requires a vigorous process of debate and discussion, in writing and in seminars. A broad consensus needs to come about on what will work, within the analytical community. In the Indian context, this is often assisted by the expert committee process. The purpose of the expert committee process is to sift through an array of possible policy pathways that are in the fray at the end of stage 3, and filter down to a few which make sense. The best expert committee reports help mainstream novel ideas in policy reform, and pull together the state of the art into a report. As Isher Ahluwalia says, nothing gets done by writing it in a government committee report, but nothing ever got done without it being repeatedly written into multiple government committee reports. </p></div><div><p dir="auto">Stage 5 of the policy pipeline is the internal government process of decision making.

Most policy decisions must be implemented through law that is enacted by the legislature, or subordinate legislation in the form of rules or regulations. High technical quality, and subtle detail, of this drafting process is of great importance. In India, all too often, the drafting of law is done by persons who have a superficial understanding of the prior stages of the policy pipeline, which leads to poor drafting of law.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Finally, stage 7 of the policy pipeline is the construction of state capacity, in the form of administrative structures that enforce the law.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The economist <a href="?query=tag:SatyaPoddar" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#SatyaPoddar</a> thinks in terms of a four-part story:<br>

This will require capacity and resourcing at the principal</p></div><div><p dir="auto">Three elements of wisdom are useful in designing sound agency arrangements. <em>The separation of powers doctrine argues that it is better to separate legislative, executive and judicial powers across three distinct organizations.</em> To the extent that more than one of these is brought into a single organization, there is concentration of power, which inevitably leads to abuse of power.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The rule of law is also a tool for achieving state capacity. When there are failures on the rule of law, this places arbitrary power in the hands of officials and politicians. This leads to abuse of power and low state capacity.</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The third element of wisdom is about the powers of an agency. At the outset, <em>it is important to give low powers to an agency</em>. Government agencies should have low levels of direct and indirect coercive power. This includes the power to raid a person, the power to tap phone conversations, the power to spend money, the power to punish a person, etc. Power corrupts, and the greater the power of the personnel</p></div><div><p dir="auto">The law that establishes an agency requires six key elements:</p></div><div><ol>
<li data-line="0" dir="auto"><strong>Clarity of objective</strong>: Accountability can only come about when there is clarity of purpose. Vague, multiple or conflicting objectives cater to corruption and incompetence.</li>
<li data-line="1" dir="auto"><strong>Formal processes for legislative functions</strong>: The law must write the due process through which the agency wields the power to write law.</li>
<li data-line="2" dir="auto"><strong>Formal processes for executive functions</strong>: The law must write the due process through which the agency performs executive functions like licensing and investigation. This is analogous to the role of the Criminal Procedure Code in binding the police to how they function.</li>
<li data-line="3" dir="auto"><strong>Formal processes for judicial functions</strong>: The law must write the due process through which the judicial functions are performed. There must be a hearing, the person conducting the proceedings must be unconflicted, orders and penalties must be reasoned, and an efficacious appeal must be possible.</li>
<li data-line="4" dir="auto"><strong>Reporting and accountability</strong>: The agency must release enough information about its own functioning so as to be held accountable for its use of public resources and wielding the coercive power of the state.</li>
<li data-line="5" dir="auto"><strong>Board</strong>: The law must write the role and structure of the board. The board must have a majority of non-government members, who must hold the management accountable; and the board must control the design of the organization. A majority of outside directors is essential in switching the strategic conversations from loyalty to voice”</li>
